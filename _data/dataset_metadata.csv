GSE10089,"In order to ascertain the potential for histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor-based treatment in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we analyzed the anti-tumour effects of Trichostatin A (TSA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (vorinostat) in a panel of 16 NSCLC cell lines via MTT assay.  TSA and vorinostat both displayed strong anti-tumor activities in a proportion of NSCLC cell lines, and suggesting the need for the use of predictive markers to select patients receiving this treatment.  There was a strong correlation between the responsiveness to TSA and vorinostat (P < 0.0001). To identify a molecular model of sensitivity to HDAC inhibitor treatment in NSCLC, we conducted a gene expression profiling study using cDNA arrays on the same set of cell lines and related the cytotoxic activity of TSA to corresponding gene expression pattern using a modified NCI program.  In addition, pathway analysis was performed with Pathway Architect software.  We used nine genes, which were identified by gene-drug sensitivity correlation and pathway analysis, to build a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm model by which sensitive cell lines were distinguished from resistant cell lines.  The prediction performance of the SVM model was validated by an additional seven cell lines, resulting in a prediction value of 100% in respect to determining response to TSA.  Our results suggested that [1] HDAC inhibitors may be promising anticancer drugs to NSCLC, and [2] the nine gene classifer is useful in predicting drug sensitivity to HDAC inhibitors and may contribute to achieving individualized therapy for NSCLC patients.  training sample set: GSM94303 PC9 GSM94304 PC7 GSM94305 PC14 GSM94306 A549 GSM94308 LK2 GSM94313 RERF LC-KJ GSM94314 RERF LC-MS GSM94315 RERF-LC-AI GSM94316 PC-1 GSM94317 PC-3 GSM94319 PC-10 GSM94323 ABC-1 GSM94324 EBC-1 GSM94325 LC2/ad GSM94328 SQ-5 GSM94329 QG-56  test sample set: GSM94307 LU65 GSM94326 LC1/sq GSM94327 LC-1F GSM254967 LCOK GSM254968 LCD GSM254969 H1650 GSM254970 H1975 Keywords: HDAC inhibitor, NSCLC, cDNA array, drug sensitivity test, pathway analysis",Anti-tumor Activity of Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells,96,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE10nnn/GSE10089/,,,,,Lung Cancer ,,GSE10089,978,23,1,0.4

GSE101929,"Translational Relevance Historically, African Americans have been underrepresented in clinical cancer research. Diversity helps to ensure equal access to new cancer therapies and better treatment for everyone. Cancer research is increasingly focused on classifying patients according to molecular profiles for particular groups. We provide a detailed molecular analysis from paired NSCLC tissues that identified differential coding and noncoding RNA expression in NSCLC from African Americans (AA) and European Americans (EA). Similar to other tumor types, we determined that race-enriched gene and microRNA expression signatures suggest a more aggressive disease in African Americans. Based on predicted drug resistance to adjuvant chemotherapies, AA may not equally benefit from the same range of clinical drugs as EA. Our findings provide a rationale for integrating coding and noncoding transcriptome profiles, along with clinical, demographic, and genomic data, when determining treatment options. Abstract Purpose: To determine if racial differences in gene and microRNA expression translates to differences in lung tumor biology with clinical relevance in African Americans (AA) and European Americans (EA). Experimental Design: The NCI-Maryland Case Control Study includes seven Baltimore City hospitals and is overrepresented with AA patients (~40%). Patients that underwent curative NSCLC surgery between 1998 and 2014 were enrolled. Comparative molecular profiling used mRNA (n = 22 AAs and n = 19 EAs) and microRNA (n = 42 AAs and n = 55 EAs) expression arrays to track differences in paired fresh frozen normal tissues and lung tumor specimens from AA and EA. Pathway enrichment, predicted drug response, tumor microenvironment infiltration, cancer immunotherapy antigen profiling, and microRNA target enrichment were assessed. Results: AA-enriched differential gene expression was characterized by stem-cell and invasion pathways. Differential gene expression in lung tumors from EA were primarily characterized by cell proliferation pathways. Population-specific gene expression was partly driven by population-specific miRNA expression profiles. Drug susceptibility predictions revealed a strong inverse correlation between AA resistance and EA sensitivity to the same panel of drugs. Statistically significant differences in M1 and M2 macrophage infiltration was observed in AA (P <0.05), however, PD-L1, PD-L2 expression was similar between both. Conclusions: Comparative transcriptomic profiling revealed clear differences in lung tumor biology between AA and EA. Increased participation by AA in lung cancer clinical trials are needed to integrate, and leverage, transcriptomic differences with other clinical information to maximize therapeutic benefit in both AA and EA.

GSE10270,"Breast cancer outcome is highly variable. Whether inadvertent exposure to environmental xenobiotics evokes a biological response promoting cancer aggressiveness and a higher probability of tumor recurrence remains unknown. To determine specific molecular alterations, which arise in high-risk breast tissue in the presence of the ubiquitous xenoestrogen, bisphenol A (BPA), we employed non-malignant random periareolar fine needle aspirates (RPFNA) in a novel functional assay. Early events induced by BPA in epithelial-stromal cocultures derived from the contralateral tissue of breast cancer patients included gene expression patterns, which facilitate apoptosis evasion, endurance of microenvironmental stress, and cell cycle deregulation without a detectable increase in cell number. This BPA response profile was significantly associated with breast tumors characterized by high histologic grade (p<0.001), and large tumor size (p=0.002), resulting in decreased recurrence-free patient survival (p<0.001). Our assays demonstrate a biological “fingerprint” of probable prior exposure to endocrine disrupting agents, and suggest a scenario in which their presence in the microenvironmental milieu of high-risk breast tissue could play a deterministic role in establishing and maintaining tumor aggressiveness and poor patient outcome.

GSE103340,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease classified into four consensus molecular subtype (CMSs) with distinct biological and clinical features. This study aims to understand the value of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) in relation to these CMSs. A total of 42 primary tumors, recurrences and metastases were used to develop PDXs. Detailed genetic analyses were performed on PDXs and corresponding patient tumors to determine relationship and PDX heterogeneity. Out of 42 tumors 22 (52%) showed successfully PDX engraftment, which was biased towards metastases and CMS1 and CMS4 tumors. Importantly, gene expression analysis revealed a clinical relevant association between an engraftment gene signature and prognosis for stage II patients. Moreover, this gene signature revealed an association between Src pathway activation and positive engraftment. Src pathway activity co-aligned with CMS4 and the levels of fibronectin in tumors and was confirmed by pSrc immunohistochemistry. From this analysis we further deduced that decreased cell cycle activity is a prognostic factor for successful engraftment and related to patient prognosis. However, this is not a general phenomenon, but subtype specific as decreased cell cycle activity was highly prognostic for recurrence-free survival within CMS2 but not in CMS1 and CMS4, while it showed an inverse correlation in CMS3. These data illustrate that CRC PDX establishment is biased toward CMS1 and CMS4, which impacts translation of results derived from pre-clinical studies using PDXs.

Fresh tissues specimens from metastases of 18 patients undergone liver surgery were collected (10 synchronous and 8 metachronous lesions). Gene expression profiling was studied using Affymetrix platform. Two different profiles were identified. Pathway related to the Epidermal Growth Factor receptor (EGFr) was upregulated in metachronous lesions whereas pathways mainly related to inflammation in synchronous lesions. Real Time-PCR, Western Blotting and ELISA confirmed that the metachronous lesions had the overexpression of EGFr, but the synchronous ones had the overexpression of Cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2).

GSE11001,"The routine workflow for invasive cancer diagnostics is based on biopsy processing by formalin fixation and subsequent paraffin embedding. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples are easy to handle, stable and particularly suitable for morphologic evaluation, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. However, it has become a paradigm that these samples cannot be used for genome-wide expression analysis with microarrays. To oppose this view, we present a pilot microarray study using FFPE core needle biopsies from breast cancers as RNA source.  We found that microarray probes interrogating sequences near the poly-A-tail of the transcribed genes were well suitable to measure RNA levels in FFPE core needle biopsies. For the ER and the HER2 gene, we observed strong correlations between RNA levels measured in these probe sets and protein expression determined by immunohistochemistry (p = 0.000003 and p = 0.0022). Further, we have identified a signature of 364 genes that correlated with ER protein status and a signature of 528 genes that correlated with HER2 protein status. Many of these genes (ER: 60%) could be confirmed by analysis of an independent publicly available data set. Finally, a hierarchical clustering of the biopsies with respect to three recently reported gene expression grade signatures resulted in widely stable low and high expression grade clusters that correlated with the pathological tumor grade.  These findings support the notion that clinically relevant information can be gained from microarray based gene expression profiling of FFPE cancer biopsies. This opens new opportunities for the integration of gene expression analysis into the workflow of invasive cancer diagnostics as well as translational research in the setting of clinical studies.

GSE11121,"Estrogen receptor (ER) expression and proliferative activity are established prognostic factors in breast cancer. In a search for additional prognostic motives we analyzed the gene expression patterns of 200 tumors of patients who were not treated by systemic therapy after surgery using a discovery approach. After performing hierarchical cluster analysis, we identified co-regulated genes related to the biological process of proliferation, steroid hormone receptor expression, as well as B cell and T cell infiltration. We calculated metagenes as surrogate for all genes contained within a particular cluster and visualized the relative expression in relation to time to metastasis with principal component analysis. Distinct patterns led to the hypothesis of a prognostic role of the immune system in tumors with high expression of proliferation associated genes. In multivariate Cox regression analysis the proliferation metagene showed a significant association with metastasis-free survival of the whole discovery cohort (Hazard Ratio (HR) 2.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40-3.46). The B cell metagene showed additional independent prognostic information in carcinomas with high proliferative activity (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.46 - 0.97). A prognostic influence of the B-cell metagene was independently confirmed by multivariate analysis in a first validation cohort enriched for high grade tumors (n=286, HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62-0.98), and a second validation cohort enriched for younger patients (n=302, HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.7-0.97). Thus, we could demonstrate in three cohorts of untreated node-negative breast cancer patients, that the humoral immune system plays a pivotal role for metastasis-free survival of carcinomas of the breast.

Although genomic and epigenomic analysis explicitly discriminated HCC with intrahepatic metastasis (IM) from multicentric HCC (MC), the phenotypic similarity between the primary and recurrent tumors was not linked to the IM/MC diagnosis, but rather the integrated classification.

GSE11352,"Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation-paired end diTag cloning and sequencing strategy, we mapped estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) binding sites in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. We identified 1,234 high confidence binding clusters of which 94% are projected to be bona fide ERalpha binding regions. Only 5% of the mapped estrogen receptor binding sites are located within 5 kb upstream of the transcriptional start sites of adjacent genes, regions containing the proximal promoters, whereas vast majority of the sites are mapped to intronic or distal locations (>5 kb from 5' and 3' ends of adjacent transcript), suggesting transcriptional regulatory mechanisms over significant physical distances. Of all the identified sites, 71% harbored putative full estrogen response elements (EREs), 25% bore ERE half sites, and only 4% had no recognizable ERE sequences. Genes in the vicinity of ERalpha binding sites were enriched for regulation by estradiol in MCF-7 cells, and their expression profiles in patient samples segregate ERalpha-positive from ERalpha-negative breast tumors. The expression dynamics of the genes adjacent to ERalpha binding sites suggest a direct induction of gene expression through binding to ERE-like sequences, whereas transcriptional repression by ERalpha appears to be through indirect mechanisms. Our analysis also indicates a number of candidate transcription factor binding sites adjacent to occupied EREs at frequencies much greater than by chance, including the previously reported FOXA1 sites, and demonstrate the potential involvement of one such putative adjacent factor, Sp1, in the global regulation of ERalpha target genes. Unexpectedly, we found that only 22%-24% of the bona fide human ERalpha binding sites were overlapping conserved regions in whole genome vertebrate alignments, which suggest limited conservation of functional binding sites. Taken together, this genome-scale analysis suggests complex but definable rules governing ERalpha binding and gene regulation.

Two public colorectal cancer microarray data sets were used for discovery and validation of the WIPF1 co-expression module. Based on expression of the WIPF1 signature, we classified more than 400 additional tumors with microarray data from our own experiments or from publicly available data sets according to their WIPF1 signature expression. This allowed us to separate patient populations for colorectal cancers, breast cancers, and gliomas for which clinical characteristics like survival times and times to relapse were analyzed.

GSE130402,"Recent years have witnessed a dramatic increase in our appreciation of the contribution of microRNAs (miRNAs) to cancer onset and progression. As a consequence, there has been growing interest in the development of miRNAs not only as diagnostic biomarkers of cancer but also as a promising new class of therapeutic agents. Over the last several years, our laboratory has focused on analysis of the molecular processes underlying the ability of individual miRNAs to induce mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) particularly in ovarian cancer. Ectopic over expression of specific miRNAs down regulated during epithelial-to mesenchymal transition (EMT) have previously been reported to induce MET in a variety of cancer cells, thereby reducing metastatic potential and resistance to standard-of-care chemotherapies. Interestingly, the ability of individual miRNAs to induce MET when over expressed in cancer cells is often cancer/cell-type specific. In an effort to better understand the molecular processes underlying this specificity, we examined the molecular and phenotypic responses of three mesenchymal-like cancer cell lines (two ovarian and one prostate) to ectopic over expression of three sequentially divergent miRNAs previously implicated in the EMT/MET process. The ability of these sequentially divergent miRNAs to induce MET in these cells was found to be associated with inherent differences in the starting molecular profiles of the untreated cancer cells and specifically, variability in trans-regulatory controls modulating the expression of genes targeted by the individual miRNAs. While our results support the view that miRNAs have significant potential as cancer therapeutic agents, our findings further indicate that optimal treatments will likely need to be personalized with respect to the molecular profiles of the individual cancers being treated.",MiRNA-mediated induction of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) between cancer cell types is significantly modulated by inter-cellular molecular variability,570,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE130nnn/GSE130402/,,,,,Ovarian Cancer,,GSE130402,978,45,2,1

GSE13787,"Introduction Basal-like (BLCs) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 overexpressing (HER2+) carcinomas are the subgroups of breast cancers which have the more aggressive clinical behavior. In contrast to HER2+ carcinomas, no targeted therapy is currently available for the treatment of patients with BLCs. In order to discover potential therapeutic targets, we searched for deregulated signaling pathways in human BLCs.  Methods In this study, we focused on the oncogenic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway in twelve BLCs, and compared it to a control series of eleven hormonal receptor negative- and grade III- matched HER2+ carcinomas. The two tumor populations were first characterized by immunohistochemistry and gene expression. The PI3K pathway was then investigated by gene copy-number analysis, gene expression profiling and at a proteomic level using reverse phase protein array technology and tissue microarray. The effects of PI3K inhibition pathway on proliferation and apoptosis was further analyzed in three human basal-like cell lines.  Results The PI3K pathway was found to be activated in BLCs and up-regulated compared to HER2+ tumors as shown by a significantly increased activation of the downstream targets Akt and mTOR. BLCs expressed significantly lower levels of the tumor suppressor PTEN and PTEN levels correlated negatively in a significant manner with Akt activity within that population.

GSE14245,"Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death. Lack of early detection technology for pancreatic cancer invariably leads to a typical clinical presentation of incurable disease at initial diagnosis. Oral fluid (saliva) meets the demand for non-invasive, accessible, and highly efficient diagnostic medium. The level of salivary analytes, such as mRNA and microflora, vary upon disease onset; thus possess valuable signatures for early detection and screening. In this study, we evaluated the performance and translational utilities of the salivary transcriptomic and microbial biomarkers for non-invasive detection of early pancreatic cancer. Two biomarker discovery technologies were used to profile transcriptome in saliva supernatant and microflora in saliva pellet. The Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array was used to discover altered gene expression in saliva supernatant. The Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM) was used to investigate microflora shift in saliva pellet. Biomarkers selected from both studies were subjected to an independent clinical validation using a cohort of 30 early pancreatic cancer, 30 chronic pancreatitis and 30 healthy matched-control saliva samples. Two panels of salivary biomarkers, including eleven mRNA biomarkers and two microbial biomarkers were discovered and validated for pancreatic cancer detection. The logistic regression model with the combination of three mRNA biomarkers (ACRV1, DMXL2 and DPM1) yielded a ROC-plot AUC value of 0.974 (95% CI, 0.896 to 0.997; P < 0.0001) with 93.3% sensitivity and 90% specificity in distinguishing pancreatic cancer patients from healthy subjects. The logistic regression model with the combination of two bacterial biomarkers (Neisseria elongata and Streptococcus mitis) yielded a ROC-plot AUC value of 0.895 (95% CI, 0.784 to 0.961; P < 0.0001) with 96.4% sensitivity and 82.1% specificity in distinguishing pancreatic cancer patients from healthy subjects. Importantly, the logistic regression model with the combination of four biomarkers (mRNA biomarkers, ACRV1, DMXL2 and DPM1; bacterial biomarker, S. mitis) could differentiate pancreatic cancer patients from all non-cancer subjects (chronic pancreatitis and healthy control), yielding a ROC-plot AUC value of 0.949 (95% CI, 0.877 to 0.985; P < 0.0001) with 92.9% sensitivity and 85.5% specificity. This study comprehensively compared the salivary transcriptome and microflora between pancreatic cancer and control subjects. We have discovered and validated eleven mRNA biomarkers and two microbial biomarkers for early detection of pancreatic cancer in saliva. The logistic regression model with four salivary biomarkers can detect pancreatic cancer specifically without the complication of chronic pancreatitis. This is the first report demonstrating the value of multiplex salivary biomarkers for the non-invasive detection of a high impact systemic cancer.

To test the hypothesis that ovarian surface epithelial cells retain properties of relatively uncommitted pluripotent cells until undergoing neoplastic transformation, we conducted gene expression profiling analysis (Affymetrix, U133 Plus 2.0) of 12 ovarian surface epithelial cells and 12 laser capture microdissected serous papillary ovarian cances. We find that over 2000 genes are significantly differentially expressed between the surface epithelial and cancer samples. Network analysis implicates key signaling pathways and pathway interactions in ovarian cancer development. Genes previously associated with adult stem cell maintenance are expressed in ovarian surface epithelial cells and significantly down-regulated in ovarian cancer cells.

GSE14764,"Ovarian carcinoma has the highest mortality rate among gynecological malignancies. In this project, we investigated the hypothesis that molecular markers are able to predict outcome of ovarian cancer independently of classical clinical predictors, and that these molecular markers can be validated using independent data sets.   We applied a semi-supervised method for prediction of patient survival. Microarrays from a cohort of 80 ovarian carcinomas (TOC cohort) were used for the development of a predictive model, which was then evaluated in an entirely independent cohort of 118 carcinomas (Duke cohort).  A 300 gene ovarian prognostic index (OPI) was generated and validated in a leave-one-out approach in the TOC cohort (Kaplan-Meier analysis, p=0.0087). In a second validation step the prognostic power of the OPI was confirmed in an independent data set (Duke cohort, p=0.0063). In multivariate analysis, the OPI was independent of the postoperative residual tumour, the main clinico-pathological prognostic parameter with an adjusted hazard ratio of 6.4 (TOC cohort, CI 1.8 – 23.5, p=0.0049) and 1.9 (Duke cohort, CI 1.2 – 3.0, p=0.0068). We constructed a combined score of molecular data (OPI) and clinical parameters (residual tumour), which was able to define patient groups with highly significant differences in survival.  The integrated analysis of gene expression data as well as residual tumour can be used for optimised assessment of prognosis. As traditional treatment options are limited, this analysis may be able to optimise clinical management and to identify those patients that would be candidates for new therapeutic strategies.

GSE14814,"Purpose: The JBR.10 trial demonstrated benefit from adjuvant cisplatin/vinorelbine (ACT) in early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We hypothesized that expression profiling may identify stage-independent subgroups who might benefit from ACT.  Patients and Methods: Gene expression profiling was conducted on mRNA from 133 frozen JBR.10 tumor samples (62 observation [OBS], 71 ACT). The minimum gene set that was selected for the greatest separation of good and poor prognosis patient subgroups in OBS patients was identified. The prognostic value of this gene signature was tested in four independent published microarray data sets and by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).  Results: A 15-gene signature separated OBS patients into high-risk and low-risk subgroups with significantly different survival (hazard ratio [HR], 15.02; 95% CI, 5.12 to 44.04; P .001; stage I HR, 13.31; P .001; stage II HR, 13.47; P .001). The prognostic effect was verified in the same 62 OBS patients where gene expression was assessed by qPCR. Furthermore, it was validated consistently in four separate microarray data sets (total 356 stage IB to II patients without adjuvant treatment) and additional JBR.10 OBS patients by qPCR (n 19). The signature was also predictive of improved survival after ACT in JBR.10 high-risk patients (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.63; P .0005), but not in low-risk patients (HR, 3.67; 95% CI, 1.22 to 11.06; P = .0133; interaction P .001). Significant interaction between risk groups and ACT was verified by qPCR.  Conclusion: This 15-gene expression signature is an independent prognostic marker in early-stage, completely resected NSCLC, and to our knowledge, is the first signature that has demonstrated the potential to select patients with stage IB to II NSCLC most likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin/vinorelbine.",Prognostic and Predictive Gene Signature for Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Resected Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer,96,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE14nnn/GSE14814/,,,,,Lung Cancer ,,GSE14814,978,133,3,0.253012048
GSE14986,"Emergence of antiestrogen-resistant cells in MCF-7 cells during suppression of estrogen signaling is a widely accepted model of acquired breast cancer resistance to endocrine therapy. To obtain insight into the genomic basis of endocrine therapy resistance, we characterized MCF-7 monoclonal sublines that survived 21-day exposure to tamoxifen (T-series sublines) or fulvestrant (F-series sublines) and sublines unselected by drugs (U-series). All T/F-sublines were resistant to the cytocidal effects of both tamoxifen and fulvestrant. However, their responses to the cytostatic effects of fulvestrant varied greatly, and their remarkably diversified morphology showed no correlation with drug resistance. mRNA expression profiles of the U-sublines differed significantly from those of the T/F-sublines, whose transcriptomal responsiveness to fulvestrant was largely lost. A set of genes strongly expressed in the U-sublines successfully predicted metastasis-free survival of breast cancer patients. Most T/F-sublines shared highly homogeneous genomic DNA aberration patterns that were distinct from those of the U-sublines. Genomic DNA of the U-sublines harbored many aberrations that were not found in the T/F-sublines. These results suggest that the T/F-sublines are derived from a common monoclonal progenitor that lost transcriptomal responsiveness to antiestrogens as a consequence of genetic abnormalities many population doublings ago, not from the antiestrogen-sensitive cells in the same culture during the exposure to antiestrogens. Thus, the apparent acquisition of antiestrogen resistance by MCF-7 cells reflects selection of preexisting drug-resistant subpopulations without involving changes in individual cells. Our results suggest the importance of clonal selection in endocrine therapy resistance of breast cancer.",Antiestrogen-resistant subclones of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells are derived from a common clonal drug-resistant progenitor,570,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE14nnn/GSE14986/,,,,,Breast Cancer,,GSE14986,978,30,2,0.375

GSE15026,"Cultured cancer cells exhibit substantial phenotypic heterogeneity when measured in a variety of ways such as sensitivity to drugs or the capacity to grow under various conditions.  Among these, the ability to exhibit anchorage-independent cell growth (colony forming capacity in semisolid media), has been considered to be fundamental in cancer biology, because it has been connected with tumor cell aggressiveness in vivo such as tumorigenic and metastatic potentials, and also utilized as a marker for in vitro transformation.  Although multiple genetic factors for anchorage-independence have been identified, the molecular basis for this capacity is still largely unknown.  To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying anchorage independent cell growth, we have used genome-wide DNA microarray studies to develop an expression signature associated with this phenotype.  Using this signature, we identify a program of activated mitochondrial biogenesis associated with the phenotype of anchorage-independent growth and importantly, we demonstrate that this phenotype predicts potential for metastasis in primary breast and lung tumors.

They have been shown to function as estrogen receptor co-repressors, and there is evidence for a role in breast tumorigenesis. To identify their endogenous target genes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we utilized gene expression array analysis, which was set up in a two-by-four design, with vehicle and estrogen treatment, and control, SAFB1, SAFB2, and SAFB1/SAFB2 siRNA as variables. Using custom chips containing 1.5 kb upstream regulatory region, we identified 541 SAFB1/SAFB2 binding sites in promoters of known genes, with significant enrichment on chromosome 1 and 6. Gene expression analysis revealed that the majority of target genes were induced in the absence of SAFB1 or SAFB2, and less were repressed. In contrast to SAFB2, which shared most of its target genes with SAFB1, SAFB1 had many unique target genes, most of them involved in regulation of the immune system. A subsequent analysis of the estrogen treatment group revealed that twelve percent of estrogen-regulated genes were dependent on SAFB1, with the majority being estrogen-repressed genes. These were primarily genes involved in apoptosis, such as BBC3, NEDD9, and OPG. Thus, this study confirms SAFB1/SAFB2’s primary role as co-repressors, and also uncovers a previously unknown role for SAFB1 in regulation of immune genes, and in estrogen-mediated repression of genes.",SAFB1 mediates repression of immune regulators and apoptotic genes in breast cancer cells,571,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE15nnn/GSE15548/,,,,,Breast Cancer,,GSE15548,978,29,2,0.75

Gene expression was correlated to disease progression and a metastasis gene signature was derived. Gene signatures were identified for each tumor type with 100% accuracy. Differentially expressed genes during early tumor formation and tumor progression to metastatic RCC were found. Subsets of these genes code for secreted proteins and membrane receptors and are both potential therapeutic or diagnostic targets.

Here, we aim to investigate the ability of the GGI to predict relapses in postmenopausal women who were treated with tamoxifen (T) or letrozole (L) within the BIG 1-98 trial.  Methods: We generated gene expression profiles (Affymetrix) and computed the GGI for a matched, case-control sample of patients enrolled in the BIG 1-98 trial from the two hospitals where frozen samples were available. All relapses (cases) were identified from patients randomized to receive monotherapy or from the switching treatment arms for whom relapse occurred before the switch.  Each case was randomly matched with four controls based upon nodal status and treatment (T or L).  The prognostic value of GGI was assessed as a continuous predictor and divided at the median.  Predictive accuracy of GGI was estimated using time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curves.  Results:  Frozen samples were analyzable for 48 patients (10 cases and 38 controls).  Seven of the 10 cases had been assigned to receive L. Cases and controls were comparable with respect to menopausal and nodal status, local and chemotherapy, and HER2 positivity. Cases were slightly older than controls and had a larger proportion of large, poorly differentiated ER+/PgR- tumors.  The GGI was significantly and linearly related to risk of relapse: each 10-unit increase in GGI resulted in an increase of approximately 11% in the hazard rate (p=0.02).  Within the subgroups of patients with node-positive disease or who were treated with L, the hazard of relapse was significantly greater for patients with GGI at or above the median. AUC reached a maximum of 78% at 27 months. Conclusions: This analysis supports the GGI as a good predictor of relapse for ER-positive patients, even among patients who receive L.  Validation of these results, in a larger series from BIG 1-98, is planned using the simplified GGI represented by a smaller set of genes and tested by qRT-PCR on paraffin-embedded tissues.

GSE16873,"Proliferative breast lesions, such as simple ductal hyperplasia (SH) and atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), are candidate precursors to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive cancer. To better understand their relationship to more advanced disease, we used microdissection and DNA microarrays to profile the gene expression of patient-matched histologically normal (HN), ADH, and DCIS from 12 patients with ER+ sporadic breast cancer. SH were profiled from a subset of cases. We found 837 differentially expressed genes between DCIS-HN and 447 between ADH-HN, with >90% of the ADH-HN genes also present among the DCIS-HN genes. Only 61 genes were identified between ADH-DCIS. Expression differences were reproduced in an independent cohort of patient-matched lesions by qRT-PCR. Many breast cancer-related genes and pathways were dysregulated in ADH and maintained in DCIS. Particularly, cell adhesion and extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions were overrepresented. Focal adhesion was the top pathway in each gene set. We conclude that ADH and DCIS share highly similar gene expression and are distinct from HN. In contrast, SH appear more similar to HN. These data provide genetic evidence that ADH (but not SH) are often precursors to cancer and suggest cancer-related genetic changes, particularly adhesion and ECM pathways, are dysregulated prior to invasion and even before malignancy is apparent. These findings could lead to novel risk stratification, prevention, and treatment approaches.

We used a gene expression profile derived from invasive murine colon cancer cells that were highly metastatic in an immunocompetent mouse model to identify colon cancer patients at risk for recurrence in a phase I, exploratory biomarker study.  Methods:  55 colorectal cancer patients from Vanderbilt Medical Center (VMC) were used as the training dataset and 177 patients from the Moffitt Cancer Center were used as the independent dataset. The metastasis-associated gene expression profile developed from the mouse model was refined using comparative functional genomics in the VMC gene expression profiles to identify a 34-gene classifier associated with high risk of metastasis and death from colon cancer.  A recurrence score derived from the biologically based classifier was tested in the Moffitt dataset.  Results:  A high score was significantly associated with increased risk of metastasis and death from colon cancer across all pathological stages and specifically in stage II and stage III patients.  The recurrence score was shown to independently predict risk of cancer recurrence and death in both univariate and multivariate models.  For example, among stage III patients, a high score translated to increased relative risk for cancer recurrence (hazard ratio = 4.7 (95% CI=1.566-14.05)).

GSE18088,"Background  Published multi-gene classifiers suggested outcome prediction for patients with stage UICC II colon cancer based on different gene expression signatures. However, there is currently no translation of these classifiers for application in routine diagnostic. Therefore, we aimed at validating own and published gene expression signatures employing methods which enable RNA and protein detection in routine diagnostic specimens.    Results  Immunohistochemistry was applied to 68 stage UICC II colon cancers to determine the protein expression of five selected previously published classifier genes (CDH17, LAT, CA2, EMR3, and TNFRSF11A). Correlation of protein expression data with clinical outcome within a 5-year post-surgery course failed to separate patients with a disease-free follow-up [Group DF] and relapse [Group R]). In addition, RNA from macrodissected tumor samples from 53 of these 68 patients was profiled on Affymetrix GeneChips (HG-U133 Plus 2.0). Prognostic signatures were generated by Nearest Shrunken Centroids with cross-validation. Although gene expression profiling allowed the identification of differentially expressed genes between the groups DF and R, a stable classification and prognosis signature was not discernable in our data. Furthermore, the application of previously published gene signatures consisting of 22 and 19 genes, respectively, to our gene expression data set using ‘global tests’ and leave-one-out cross-validation was unable to predict clinical outcome (prediction rate 75.5% and 64.2%; n.s.). T-stage was the only independent prognostic factor for relapse in multivariate analysis with established clinical and pathological parameters including microsatellite status.  Conclusions  Our protein and gene expression analyses currently do not support application of molecular classifiers for prediction of clinical outcome in routine diagnostic as a basis for patient-orientated therapy in stage UICC II colon cancer.

In order to identify genes influencing the prognosis of patients with CRC, we compared gene expression in primary tumors with and without distant metastasis using an oligonucleotide microarray. We also examined the expression of the candidate gene in 100 CRC patients by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR and studied the relationship between its expression and the prognosis of patients with CRC. As a result, we identified MUC12 as a candidate gene involved in metastasis processes by microarray analysis. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR showed that MUC12 expression was significantly lower in cancer tissues than in adjacent normal tissues (P < 0.001). In stage II and stage III CRC, patients with low expression showed worse disease-free survival (P = 0.038). Multivariate analysis disclosed that MUC12 expression status was an independent prognostic factor in stage II and stage III CRC (relative risk, 9.532; 95% confidence interval, 2.303-41.905; P = 0.002).

The aim of the present study was to develop a gene signature of CTC and to assess its prognostic relevance after surgery for pancreatic ductaladenocarcinoma (PDAC). A negative depletion fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) procedure was developed and validated with spiking experiments using cancer cell lines in whole human blood samples. This FACS-based method was used to enrich for CTC from the blood of 10 patients who underwent surgery for PDAC. Total RNA was isolated from 4 subgroup samples, i.e. CTC, haematological cells (G), original tumor (T), and non-tumoral pancreatic control tissue (P). After RNA quality control, samples of 6 patients were eligible for further analysis. Whole genome microarray analysis was performed after double linear amplification of RNA. The ‘Ingenuity Pathway Analysis’ software and AmiGO were used for functional data analyses. A CTC gene signature was developed and validated with the nCounter system on expression data of 78 primary PDAC using Cox regression analysis for disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Using stringent statistical analysis, we finally retained 8,152 genes to compare expression profiles of CTC vs. other subgroups, and found 1,059 genes to be differentially expressed. The pathway with the highest expression ratio in CTC was p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) signaling, known to be involved in cancer cell migration. In the p38 MAPK pathway TGF-β1, cPLA2, and MAX were significantly upregulated. In addition, 9 other genes associated with both p38 MAPK signaling and cell motility were over-expressed in CTC.

GSE19697,"A gene expression signature characterizes expression data from breast cancer samples of patients with pathological complete response (pCR) or residual disease (RD) following the neoadjuvant trial. Several gene expression profiles have been reported to predict breast cancer response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These studies often consider breast cancer as a homogeneous entity, although higher rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) are known to occur within the basal-like subclass. We postulated that profiles with higher predictive accuracy could be derived from a subset analysis of basal-like tumors in isolation. Using a previously described ‘‘intrinsic’’ signature to differentiate breast tumor subclasses, we identified 50 basal-like tumors from two independent clinical trials associated with gene expression profile data. 24 tumor data sets (included in this GEO submission) were derived from a 119-patient neoadjuvant trial at our institution and an additional 26 tumor data sets were identified from a published data set (Hess et al. J Clin Oncol 24:4236–4244, 2006). The combined 50 basal-like tumors were partitioned to form a 37 sample training set with 13 sequestered for validation. Clinical surveillance occurred for a mean of 26 months. We identified a 23-gene profile which predicted pCR in basal-like breast cancers with 92% predictive accuracy in the sequestered validation data set. Furthermore, distinct cluster of patients with high rates of cancer recurrence was observed based on cluster analysis with the 23-gene signature. Disease-free survival analysis of these three clusters revealed significantly reduced survival in the patients of this high recurrence cluster. We identified a 23- gene signature which predicts response of basal-like breast cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy as well as disease-free survival.

Methods: We analyzed gene expression in 73 NlEpi samples microdissected from frozen tissue. In 42 cases, we used Affymetrix HU133A microarrays to compare gene expression in 18 RM vs 18 age-matched HN (9 ER+, 9 ER-) and 6 PM. Data were validated with qPCR in 31 independent NlEpi samples (8 RM, 17 HN, 6 PM). Results: 98 probesets (86 genes) were differentially expressed between RM and HN samples. Perfoming supervised hierarchical analysis with these 98 probesets, PM and HN samples clustered together, away from RM samples. qPCR validation of independent samples was high (84%) and uniform in RM vs HN, and lower (58%), but more heterogeneous, in RM vs PM. The 86 genes were implicated in many processes including transcription and the MAPK pathway. Conclusion: Gene expression differs between NlEpi of cancer cases and controls. The cancer cases' profile can be discerned in high-risk NlEpi. This suggests that the profile is not an effect of the tumor, but may mark increased risk and reveal breast cancer's earliest genomic changes. We determined that 98 probesets significantly differed between reduction mammoplasty and histologically normal epithelium from breast cancer patients. We also found that the histologically normal epithelium from prophylactic mastectomy patients' gene expression was more similar to histologically normal epithelium from breast cancer patients' than to reduction mammoplasty patients' gene expression.

Experimental Design: The expression profiles of cancer cells in 104 patients with CRC were examined using laser microdissection and oligonucleotide microarray analysis. Overexpression in CRC cells especially in patients with distant metastasis was a prerequisite to select candidate genes. The mRNA expression of candidate gene was investigated by quantitative reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 77 patients as a validation study. We analyzed the protein expression and localization of the candidate gene by immunohistochemical study, and investigated the relationship between the expression and the clinicopathological feature in 274 CRC patients. Results: We identified 6 genes as candidates related to distant metastasis in CRC patients by microarray analysis. Among these genes, Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is known to have an association with aggressiveness in several cancers through inhibiting apoptosis by neutralizing the function of tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL). The mRNA expression of OPG in cancer tissues was significantly higher in patients with distant metastasis than those without metastasis. The overexpression of OPG protein was significantly associated with worse overall survival and relapse free survival (RFS). Moreover, the overexpression of OPG protein was an independent risk factor for recurrence of CRC.

We developed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier based on this 368-gene list in a learning set, and tested its predictive performances in an independent validation set. Then, we assessed its prognostic value and that of six prognostic signatures for disease-free survival (DFS) in the remaining 2034 samples. The SVM model accurately classified all MBC samples in the learning and validation sets. A total of 466 cases were basal across other sets.

GSE21947,"Background: We hypothesize that important genomic differences between breast cancer subtypes occur early in carcinogenesis. Therefore, gene expression might distinguish histologically normal breast epithelium (NlEpi) from breasts containing estrogen receptor positive (ER+) compared with estrogen receptor negative (ER-) cancers. Methods: We examined gene expression in 46 cases of microdissected NlEpi from previously untreated women undergoing breast cancer surgery. From 30 age-matched cases (15 ER+, 15 ER-) we used Affymetryix U133A arrays. From 16 independent cases (9ER+, 7 ER-), we validated seven selected genes using qPCR. We then compared gene expression between NlEpi and invasive breast cancer using 4 publicly available datasets. Results: 216 probes (corresponding to 198 unique genes) distinguished the NlEpi from breasts with ER+ (NlEpiER+) compared to ER- cancers (NlEpiER-). These include genes characteristic of ER+ and ER- cancers themselves, (e.g., ESR1, GATA3, and CX3CL1, FABP7, respectively). QPCR validated the microarray results in both a sampling of the 30 original cases (84%) and all of the 16 independent cases (77%). Gene expression in NlEpiER+ and NlEPIERNlEpiER- resembled gene expression in ER+ and ER- cancers, respectively: 36%-53% of the genes or probes examined in each the 4 external datasets overlapped between NlEpi and the corresponding cancer subtype. Conclusions: Gene expression differs in NlEpi of breasts containing ER+ compared to ER- breast cancers.  These differences echo differences in ER+ and ER- invasive cancers. Thus, breast cancer subtypes may be detectable before histologic abnormalities. NlEpi gene expression may help define subtype-specific risk signatures, identify initial subtype specific genomic differences, and suggest new targets for subtype-specific prevention and therapy.  We determined that 216 probesets significantly differed between histologically normal epithelium from ER+ breast cancer patients and from ER- breast cancer patients, and that gene expression in each type of histologically normal epithelium resembles expression of the corresponding subtype of invasive breast cancer (i.e., ER+ or ER-). These findings suggest that characteristic features of breast cancer subtypes are detectable prior to any histologic abnormality.

Patients with high-risk, operable breast cancer were treated with three cycles of paclitaxel followed by concurrent paclitaxel/radiation. Tumor tissue from pretreatment biopsies was obtained from 19 of the 38 patients enrolled in the study. Protein and gene expression profiling were done on serial sections of the biopsies from patients that achieved a pathologic complete response (pCR) and compared to those with residual disease, non-pCR (NR).  Proteomic and validation immunohistochemical analyses revealed that α-defensins (DEFA) were overexpressed in tumors from patients with a pCR. Gene expression analysis revealed that MAP2, a microtubule-associated protein, had significantly higher levels of expression in patients achieving a pCR. Elevation of MAP2 in breast cancer cell lines led to increased paclitaxel sensitivity. Furthermore, expression of genes that are associated with the basal-like, triple-negative phenotype were enriched in tumors from patients with a pCR. Analysis of a larger panel of tumors from patients receiving presurgical taxane-based treatment showed that DEFA and MAP2 expression as well as histologic features of inflammation were all statistically associated with response to therapy at the time of surgery.

Results: We found 75 candidate genes that were potentially suppressed by DNA methylation in CRC.

The mRNA expression analysis using tissue samples revealed that UNC5B mRNA was down-expressed in about 20% of CRC patients, and the patients with low-UNC5B-expression tumors showed a significantly higher recurrence rate after curative surgery. According to the univariate and multivariate analysis, low UNC5B expression was an independent risk factor for postoperative recurrence in stage I, II, and III CRC patients. Furthermore, patients with low expression of UNC5B in tumors had significantly poorer prognosis than those with high expression of UNC5B.

Additionally, hormone receptor (HR)-negative breast cancers (p<0.001) and advanced stage disease ovarian cancers (p=0.026) also demonstrated high CHAC1 mRNA levels. mRNA expression analysis of the two known CHAC1 isoforms showed a strong association of expression above the median with poor outcome in breast cancer patients in a multivariate analysis (isoform a: relative risk (RR) of death 3.2 (95% CI 1.6-6.5; p<0.01); RR of relapse 3.9 (95% CI 1.6-9.8; p<0.01); isoform b: relative risk (RR) of death 3.5 (95% CI 1.6-7.3; p<0.01); RR of relapse 6.6 (95% CI 2.4-18.5; p<0.01)). Univariate analysis in ovarian cancer showed that CHAC1 mRNA expression above the median was associated with a poor relapse free survival (p=0.03). In younger ovarian cancer patients (age < median age), a high CHAC1 mRNA expression was associated with overall survival (p=0.007) and relapse free survival (p=0.015). Finally, we show that downregulation of CHAC1 by small interfering RNA suppressed breast cancer cell migration and proliferation, whereas overexpression resulted in an observed increase in these cellular behaviours. This is the first report demonstrating that a gene (CHAC1) whose expression is triggered by methylated, but not unmethylated DNA, is involved in tumour biology.",CHAC1 mRNA expression is a strong prognostic biomarker in breast and ovarian cancer,570,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE22nnn/GSE22865/,,,,,Breast Cancer,,GSE22865,978,12,1,1

GSE23177,"Lymph node involvement is the most important prognostic factor in breast cancer, but little is known about the underlying molecular changes. First, to identify a molecular signature associated with nodal metastasis, gene expression analysis was performed on a homogeneous group of 96 primary breast tumors, balanced for lymph node involvement. Each tumor was diagnosed as a poorly differentiated, estrogen positive, her2-neu negative invasive ductal cancer. (Affymetrix Human U133 Plus 2.0 microarray chips). A model, including 241 genes was built and validated on an internal and external dataset performed with Affymetrix technology. All samples used for validation had the same characteristics as the initial tumors. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the internal dataset was 0.646 and 0.651 for the external datasets. Thus, the molecular profile of a breast tumor reveals information about lymph node involvement, even in a homogeneous group of tumors. However, an AUC of 0.65 indicates only a weak correlation. Our model includes multiple kinases, apoptosis related and zinc ion binding genes. Pathway analysis using the Molecular Signatures Database revealed relevant gene sets (BAF57, Van 't Veer). Next, miRNA profiling was performed on 82/96 tumors using Human MiRNA microarray chips (Illumina). Eight miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed according to lymph node status at a significance level of 0.05, without correcting for multiple testing. The analysis of the inverse correlation between a miRNA and its computationally predicted targets point to general deregulation of the miRNA machinery potentially responsible for lymph node invasion.

GSE23554,"Background. Genome-wide expression changes are associated with development of chemoresistance in patients with ovarian cancer (OVCA); the BCL2 antagonist of cell death (BAD) apoptosis pathway may play a role in clinical outcome. Methods.  We analyzed specimens and/or genomic data from 1,406 patients and 116 cancer cell lines.  Genome-wide expression changes and cisplatin-resistance were evaluated in OVCA cell lines subjected to a total of 144 (cisplatin)-treatment/recovery cycles. Pathway analysis was performed on genes associated with increasing cisplatin-resistance.  BAD protein phosphorylation was studied in patient samples and cell lines, and small interfering RNAs (siRNA) used to explore the pathway as a therapeutic target. We evaluated the influence of BAD-pathway expression on chemosensitivity and/or clinical outcome using genomic data from 60 human cancer cell lines and ovarian, breast, colon, and brain cancers from 1,258 patients. Results.  The BAD pathway was associated with evolution of OVCA cell line cisplatin-resistance (P<0.001) and resistance of 7 human cancer cell types to 8 cytotoxic agents (P<0.05).  OVCA chemoresistance was associated with BAD protein phosphorylation, and targeted siRNA modulation produced corresponding changes in chemosensitivity. Expression of a 47-gene BAD-pathway signature was associated with survival of 1,258 patients with ovarian, breast, colon, and brain cancer.  The OVCA BAD-pathway signature survival advantage was independent of surgical cytoreductive status. Conclusions.  The BAD apoptosis pathway influences the sensitivity of human cancers to a variety of chemotherapies, likely via modulation of BAD-phosphorylation.

GSE24468,"Both pro- and anti-mitogenic activities have been ascribed to progesterone receptor (PR) agonists and antagonists in breast cancer cells, however, the transcriptional responses that underlie these paradoxical functions are not apparent. Using non-transformed, normal human mammary epithelial cells (hMECs) engineered to express PR, and standard microarray technology, we defined 2,370 genes that were significantly regulated by the PR agonist R5020. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that GO-terms involved in inflammation and NF-κB signaling were among the most significantly regulated. Interestingly, on those NF-κB responsive genes that were inhibited by agonist-activated PR, antagonists either (a) mimicked the actions of agonists or (b) reversed the inhibitory actions of agonists.  This difference in pharmacological response could be attributed to the fact that although agonist and antagonist-activated PR is recruited to the promoters of NF-κB responsive promoters, the physical presence of PR tethered to the promoter of some genes is sufficient for transcriptional inhibition whereas on others an agonist-activated PR conformation is required for inhibition of NF-κB signaling.  Importantly, the actions of PR on the latter class of genes were reversed by an AF-2 inhibiting, LXXLL-containing peptide. Consideration of the relative activities of these distinct anti-inflammatory pathways in breast cancer may be instructive with respect to the likely therapeutic activity of PR agonists or antagonists in the treatment of breast cancer.",Elucidation of the Mechanisms by which the Progesterone Receptor Inhibits Inflammatory Responses in Cellular Models of Breast Cancer,570,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE24nnn/GSE24468/,,,,,Breast Cancer,,GSE24468,978,20,1,1

GSE24717,"Given the very substantial heterogeneity of most human cancers, it is likely that most cancer therapeutics will be active in only a small fraction of any population of patients. As such, the development of new therapeutics, coupled with methods to match a therapy with the individual patient, will be critical to achieving significant gains in disease outcome. One such opportunity is the use of expression signatures to identify key oncogenic phenotypes that can serve not only as biomarkers but also as a means of identifying therapeutic compounds that might specifically target these phenotypes. Given the potential importance of targeting tumors exhibiting a stem-like phenotype, we have developed an expression signature that reflects common biological aspects of various stem-like characteristics.  The Consensus Stemness Ranking (CSR) signature is upregulated in cancer stem cell enriched samples, at advanced tumor stages and is associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancer types. Using two independent computational approaches we utilized the CSR signature to identify clinically useful compounds that could target the CSR phenotype. In vitro assays confirmed selectivity of several predicted compounds including topoisomerase inhibitors and resveratrol towards breast cancer cell lines that exhibit a high-CSR phenotype. Importantly, the CSR signature could predict clinical response of breast cancer patients to a neoadjuvant regimen that included a CSR-specific agent.

GSE24795,"16 replication error proficient (RER-/MSI-) and 14 replication error deficient (RER+/MSI+) colorectal cancer cell lines Replication error deficient (RER+) colorectal cancers are a distinct subset of colorectal cancers, characterised by inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair system.  They are typically pseudodiploid, accumulate mutations in repetitive sequences as a result of their mismatch repair deficiency, and have distinct pathologies.  Regulatory sequences controlling all aspects of mRNA processing, including especially message stability are found in the 3’UTR sequence of most genes.  The relevant sequences are typically A/U rich elements and/or U repeats. Microarray analysis of 14 RER+ (deficient) and 16 RER- (proficient) colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines confirms a striking difference in expression profiles. Analysis of the incidence of mononucleotide repeat sequences in the 3’UTRs, 5’UTRs and coding sequences of those genes most differentially expressed in RER+ versus – cell lines has shown that much of this differential expression can be explained by the occurrence of a massive enrichment of genes with 3’UTR T repeats longer than 11 base pairs in the most differentially expressed genes. This enrichment was confirmed by analysis of two published consensus sets of RER differentially expressed probe sets for a large number of primary colorectal cancers.   Sequence analysis of the 3’UTRs of a selection of the most differentially expressed genes shows that they all contain deletions in these repeats in all RER+ cell lines studied. These data strongly imply that deregulation of mRNA stability through accumulation of mutations in repetitive regulatory 3’UTR sequences underlies the striking difference in expression profiles between RER+ and RER- colorectal cancers.",Gene Expression differences between replication error deficient and proficient colorectal cancers: the dominant role of deletions in 3’UTR poly T sequences,570,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE24nnn/GSE24795/,,,,,Colorectal Cancer,,GSE24795,978,30,1,0.875

GSE25428,"Epithelial ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death among gynecologic malignancies.  Diagnosis usually occurs after metastatic spread, largely reflecting vague symptoms of early disease combined with lack of an effective screening strategy.  Epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation, including DNA methylation, are fundamental to normal cellular function and also play a major role in carcinogenesis. To elucidate the biological and clinical relevance of DNA methylation in ovarian cancer, we conducted expression microarray analysis of 39 cell lines and 17 primary culture specimens grown in the presence or absence of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors. Two parameters, induction of expression and standard deviation among untreated samples, identified 378 candidate methylated genes, many relevant to TGF-beta signaling. We analyzed 43 of these genes and they all exhibited methylation.  Treatment with DNMT inhibitors increased TGF-beta pathway activity. Hierarchical clustering of ovarian cancers using the 378 genes reproducibly generated a distinct gene cluster strongly correlated with TGF-beta pathway activity that discriminates patients based on age. These data suggest that accumulation of age-related epigenetic modifications leads to suppression of TGF-beta signaling and contributes to ovarian carcinogenesis.  The cancer stem cell hypothesis posits that malignant growth arises from a rare population of progenitor cells within a tumor that provide it with unlimited regenerative capacity. Such cells also possess increased resistance to chemotherapeutic agents.  Resurgence of chemoresistant disease following primary therapy typifies epithelial ovarian cancer and may be attributable to residual cancer stem cells, or cancer initiating cells, that survive initial treatment.  As the cell surface marker CD133 identifies cancer initiating cells in a number of other malignancies, we sought to determine the potential role of CD133+ cells in epithelial ovarian cancer.  We detected CD133 on ovarian cancer cell lines, in primary cancers, and on purified epithelial cells from ascitic fluid of ovarian cancer patients. We found CD133+ ovarian cancer cells generate both CD133+ and CD133- daughter cells, whereas CD133- cells divide symmetrically. CD133+ cells exhibit enhanced resistance to platinum-based therapy, drugs commonly used as first line agents for treatment of ovarian cancer.  Sorted CD133+ ovarian cancer cells also form more aggressive tumor xenografts at a lower inoculum than their CD133- progeny. Epigenetic changes may be integral to the behavior of cancer progenitor cells and their progeny.  In this regard, we found that CD133 transcription is controlled by both histone modifications and promoter methylation. Sorted CD133- ovarian cancer cells treated with DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors show a synergistic increase in cell surface CD133 expression.  Moreover, DNA methylation at the ovarian tissue active P2 promoter is inversely correlated with CD133 transcription.  We also found that promoter methylation increases in CD133- progeny of CD133+ cells, with CD133+ cells retaining a less methylated or unmethylated state. Taken together, our results show that CD133 expression in ovarian cancer is directly regulated by epigenetic modifications and support the idea that CD133 demarcates an ovarian cancer initiating cell population.  The activity of these cells may be epigenetically detected and such cells might serve as pertinent chemotherapeutic targets for reducing disease recurrence.",Gene expression profiles of ovarian cancer cell lines in the presence and absence of a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor,3921,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE25nnn/GSE25428/,,,,,Ovarian Cancer,,GSE25428,978,95,1,0.022727273

GSE26511,"Purpose: Presence of pelvic lymph node metastases is the main prognostic factor in early stage cervical cancer patients, primarily treated with surgery. Aim of this study was to identify cellular tumor pathways associated with pelvic lymph node metastasis in early stage cervical cancer. Experimental Design: Gene expression profiles (Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0) of 20 patients with negative (N0) and 19 with positive lymph nodes (N+), were compared with gene sets that represent all 285 presently available pathway signatures. Validation immunostaining of tumors of 274 consecutive early stage cervical cancer patients was performed for representatives of the identified pathways. Results: Analysis of 285 pathways resulted in identification of five pathways (TGF-β, NFAT, ALK, BAD, and PAR1) that were dysregulated in the N0, and two pathways (β-catenin and Glycosphingolipid Biosynthesis Neo Lactoseries) in the N+ group. Class comparison analysis revealed that five of 149 genes that were most significantly differentially expressed between N0 and N+ tumors (P<0.001) were involved in β-catenin signaling (TCF4, CTNNAL1, CTNND1/p120, DKK3 and WNT5a). Immunohistochemical validation of two well-known cellular tumor pathways (TGF-β and β-catenin) confirmed that the TGF-β pathway (positivity of Smad4) was related to N0 (OR:0.20, 95%CI:0.06-0.66) and the β-catenin pathway (p120 positivity) to N+ (OR:1.79, 95%CI:1.05-3.05).

Leave-one-out cross-validation was applied to each tumor cohort and confirmed by a permutation test. External validation was conducted by applying the gene signature to a publicly available array database of expression profiles of advanced stage suboptimally debulked tumors. The prognostic signature successfully classified the tumors according to survival for suboptimally (P = 0.0179) but not optimally debulked (P = 0.144) patients. The suboptimal gene signature was validated using the independent set of tumors (odds ratio, 8.75; P = 0.0146). To elucidate signaling events amenable to therapeutic intervention in suboptimally debulked patients, pathway analysis was completed for the top 57 survival-associated probe sets. For suboptimally debulked patients, confirmation of the predictive gene signature supports the existence of a clinically relevant predictor, as well as the possibility of novel therapeutic opportunities. Ultimately, the prognostic classifier defined for suboptimally debulked tumors may aid in the classification and enhancement of patient outcome for this high-risk population.",A Gene Signature Predicting for Survival in Suboptimally Debulked Patients with Ovarian Cancer,96,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE26nnn/GSE26712/,,,,,Ovarian Cancer,,GSE26712,978,195,1,0.947368421
GSE26834,"Although estrogen receptor (ER) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling are important for normal mammary development and breast cancer, cross-talk between these pathways, particularly at the level of gene transcription, remains poorly understood.  We performed microarray analysis on MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with estradiol (E2) or IGF-I for 3hr or 24hr.  IGF-I regulated mRNA of 5-10-fold more genes than estradiol, and many genes were co-regulated by both ligands.  Importantly, expression of these co-regulated genes correlated with poor prognosis of human breast cancer.  Closer examination revealed enrichment of repressed transcripts.  Interestingly, a number of potential tumor suppressors were down-regulated by IGF-I and estradiol.  In fact, BLNK, one of the top repressed genes, is a potential growth suppressor in breast cancer cells.  Analysis of three down-regulated genes showed that E2-mediated repression occurred independently of IGF-IR, and IGF-I-mediated repression occurred independently of ER.  However, repression by IGF-I or estradiol required common downstream kinases.  In conclusion, E2 and IGF-I co-regulate a set of genes that affect breast cancer outcome.  There is enrichment of repressed transcripts, and the down-regulation is independent at the receptor level.  This may be important clinically, as tumors with active ER and IGF-IR signaling may require co-targeting of both pathways.

GSE26910,"Primary tumor growth induces host tissue responses that are believed to support and promote tumor progression. Identification of the molecular characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and elucidation of its crosstalk with tumor cells may therefore be crucial for improving our understanding of the processes implicated in cancer progression, identifying potential therapeutic targets, and uncovering stromal gene expression signatures that may predict clinical outcome. A key issue to resolve, therefore, is whether the stromal response to tumor growth is largely a generic phenomenon, irrespective of the tumor type, or whether the response reflects tumor-specific properties. To address similarity or distinction of stromal gene expression changes during cancer progression, oligonucleotide-based Affymetrix microarray technology was used to compare the transcriptomes of laser-microdissected stromal cells derived from invasive human breast and prostate carcinoma. Invasive breast and prostate cancer-associated stroma was observed to display distinct transcriptomes, with a limited number of shared genes. Interestingly, both breast and prostate tumor-specific dysregulated stromal genes were observed to cluster breast and prostate cancer patients, respectively, into two distinct groups with statistically different clinical outcomes. By contrast, a gene signature that was common to the reactive stroma of both tumor types did not have survival predictive value. Univariate Cox analysis identified genes whose expression level was most strongly associated with patient survival. Taken together, these observations suggest that the tumor microenvironment displays distinct features according to the tumor type that provides survival-predictive value.",Stromal molecular signatures of breast and prostate cancer,570,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE26nnn/GSE26910/,,,,,Prostate Cancer,,GSE26910,978,24,1,1
GSE27020,"Background: Local recurrence is the major manifestation of treatment failure in patients with operable laryngeal carcinoma. Established clinicopathological factors cannot sufficiently predict patients that are likely to recur after treatment. Additional tools are therefore required to accurately identify patients at high risk for recurrence.  Methods: Using Affymetrix U133A Genechips, we profiled fresh-frozen tumor tissues from 59 patients with operable laryngeal cancer. All patients were treated locally with surgery, with or without radiation therapy. We performed Cox regression proportional hazards modeling to identify multigene predictors of recurrence. The end-point of our analysis was disease-free survival (DFS). Gene models were directly validated in a separate, similarly treated cohort of 50 patients using Affymetrix chips. In an attempt to further validate our results, we profiled 12 selected genes of our model in formalin-fixed tumor tissues from an independent cohort of 75 patients, using quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).   Results: We focused on genes univariately associated with DFS (p<0.05) in the training set. Among several gene models comprising different numbers of genes, a 30-gene model demonstrated optimal performance (log-rank, p<0.001). We directly applied these gene models to the validation set, after adjusting for non-biological experimental variability, and observed similar results. Specifically, median DFS, as predicted by the 30-gene model, was 34 and 80 months for high- and low-risk patients, respectively (p=0.01). Hazard Ratio (HR) for recurrence for the high-risk group was 3.87 (95% CI 1.28-11.73, p=0.017). Furthermore, unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the 75 patients, based on the qRT-PCR 12-gene profile, yielded two groups, which differed significantly in DFS (log-rank, p=0.027). HR= for recurrence was 2.26, (95% CI 1.08-4.76, p=0.031).  Conclusion: We have established and validated gene models that can successfully stratify patients with laryngeal cancer, based on their risk for recurrence. Thus, patients with unfavorable prognosis, when accurately identified, could be ideal candidates for the application of more aggressive treatment modalities.",Identification and validation of a multigene predictor of recurrence in primary laryngeal cancer.,96,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE27nnn/GSE27020/,,,,,[],,GSE27020,978,109,2,0.453333333

Since the pioneer work of Allinen et al. suggested that during breast cancer progression striking changes occur in CD10+ stromal cells, we aimed to better characterize this cell population and its clinical relevance. Results: This 12-gene CD10+ stroma signature includes among others genes involved in matrix remodeling (MMP11, MMP13, COL10A1) and genes related to osteoblast differentiation (periostin). The co-culture experiments demonstrated all three CD10+ cell types contribute to the CD10+ stroma signature. Of interest, this signature demonstrated an important role in differentiating in situ from invasive breast cancer, in prognosis of the HER2+ subpopulation of breast cancer only, and potentially in non-response to chemotherapy for those patients.

Previous studies have shown that miRNAs inhibit the translation and facilitate the degradation of their targeted mRNAs making them attractive candidates for use in cancer therapy. However, the potential clinical utility of miRNAs in cancer therapy rests heavily upon our ability to understand and accurately predict the consequences of fluctuations in levels of miRNAs within the context of complex tumor cells. To evaluate the predictive power of current models, levels of miRNAs and their targeted messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were measured in laser captured micro-dissected (LCM) ovarian cancer epithelial cells (CEPI) and compared with levels present in ovarian surface epithelial cells (OSE). We found that the predicted inverse correlation between changes in levels of miRNAs and levels of their mRNA targets held for only ~6-11% of predicted target mRNAs. Our results underscore the complexities of miRNA-mediated regulation in vivo and caution against the widespread clinical application of miRNAs and miRNA inhibitors until the basis of these complexities is more fully understood.","miRNAs in ovarian cancer: A systems approach (MAS5, plier, GCRMA)",570,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE27nnn/GSE27431/,,,,,Ovarian Cancer,,GSE27431,978,30,1,0.4

The anterior gradient homolog 3 (AGR3) gene was found to be highly upregulated in serous borderline ovarian tumors; this finding was validated by real-time quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Anti-AGR3 immunohistochemistry was performed on an additional 56 LG and 103 HG tissues and the results were correlated with clinical data.  Expression profiling determined that 1254 genes were differentially expressed (P < 0.005) between SBOT, LG and HG tumors. Serous borderline ovarian tumors exhibited robust positive staining for AGR3, with a lower percentage of tumor cells stained in LG and HG. Immunofluorescence staining indicated that AGR3 expression was limited to ciliated cells.

Experimental Design: We investigated mRNA expression profiles in 115 patients with CRC using an Affymetrix Gene Chip, and copy number profiles in 122 patients with CRC using an Affymetrix DNA Sty array. Genes in common between copy number and expression data were extracted as candidate genes. We analyzed the mRNA expression of candidate gene by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 86 patients as a validation study. Furthermore, we analyzed the protein expression of candidate gene by immunohistochemical study in 269 patients, and investigated the relationship between protein expression and clinicopathologic features. Results: By the combination of copy number analysis and gene expression analysis, We extracted 2 candidate genes related with distant metastases of CRC.

GSE27914,"The proto-oncogenes ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5 encode members of the E26 transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factor family, which includes the most frequently rearranged and overexpressed genes in prostate cancer.  Despite being critical regulators of development, little is known about their post-translational regulation.  Here we identify the ubiquitin ligase COnstitutive Photomorphogenic-1 (COP1, also called RFWD2) as a tumor suppressor that negatively regulates ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5.  ETV1, which is the member mutated more frequently in prostate cancer, was degraded after being ubiquitinated by COP1.  Truncated ETV1 encoded by prostate cancer translocation TMPRSS2:ETV1 lacks the critical COP1 binding motifs (degrons) and was 50-fold more stable than wild-type ETV1.  Almost all patient translocations eliminate these ETV1 degrons, implying that translocations rendering ETV1 insensitive to COP1 confer a significant selective advantage to prostate epithelial cells.  Indeed, COP1 deficiency in mouse prostate elevated ETV1 levels and produced increased cell proliferation, hyperplasia, and early prostate intraepithelial neoplasia.  The combined loss of COP1 and PTEN enhanced the invasiveness of mouse prostate adenocarcinomas.  Finally, relatively rare human prostate cancer samples showed hemizygous loss of the COP1 gene, loss of COP1 protein expression, and abnormally elevated ETV1 protein while lacking a translocation event.  These findings identify COP1 as a bona fide tumor suppressor whose down-regulation promotes prostatic epithelial cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.","Expression data from LNCap cell line treated with COP1 (RFWD2), ETV1, and JUN siRNAs",570,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE27nnn/GSE27914/,,,,,Prostate Cancer,,GSE27914,978,31,1,0.666666667

GSE29330,"Silencing of tumor suppressor genes plays a vital role in head and neck carcinogenesis. Aberrant hypermethylation in the promoter region of some known or putative tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) occurs frequently during the development of various cancers including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In this study we used an expanded mRNA expression profiling approach followed by microarray expression analysis to identify epigenetically inactivated genes in HNSCC. Two HNSCC cell lines were treated with 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine followed by microarray analysis to identify epigenetically silenced genes in HNSCC. 1960, 614, and 427 genes were upregulated in HNSCC cell lines JHU-012, JHU-011 and the combination of both cell lines, respectively. HNSCC tumor and normal mucosal samples were used for gene profiling by a 47K mRNA gene expression array and we found, 7140 genes were downregulated in HNSCC tumors compared to normal mucosa as determined by microarray analysis and were integrated with cell line data. Integrative analysis defined 126 candidate genes, of which only seven genes showed differentially methylation in tumors and no methylation in normal mucosa after bisulfite sequencing. After validation by QMSP, one gene, GNG7, was confirmed as being highly methylated in tumors and unmethylated in normal mucosal and salivary rinse samples demonstrating cancer-specific methylation in HNSCC tissues. TXNIP and TUSC2 were partially methylated in tumors and normal salivary rinses but unmethylated in normal mucosa. We concluded GNG7 as a highly specific promoter methylated gene associated with HNSCC. In addition, TXNIP and TUSC2 are also potential biomarkers for HNSCC.",Identification of GNG7 as An Epigenetically Silenced Gene in Head and Neck Cancer by Gene Expression Profiling,570,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE29nnn/GSE29330/,,,,,Head and Neck Cancer,,GSE29330,978,18,1,0.5

Distinct subtypes of breast cancer have been defined, suggesting the existence of molecular differences contributing to their clinical outcomes. However, the molecular differences between HER2 positive and negative breast cancer tumors remain unclear. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify a gene expression profile for breast tumors based on HER2 status. Material and methods: The HER2 status was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in 54 breast tumor samples. Using Affymetrix microarray data from these breast tumors, we established the expression profiling of breast cancer based on HER2 IHC and FISH results. To validate microarray experiment data, real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed. Results: We found significant differences between the HER2-positive and HER2-negative breast tumor samples, which included overexpression of HER2, as well as other genes located on 17q12, and genes functionally related to migration.

GSE29721,"Extensive loss of DNA methylation is a hallmark of cancer. The role of hypomethylation in altering gene expression in cancer cells has been poorly understood. Hepatic cellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common human cancers. We use HCC as a model to investigate hypomethylation in cancer by a combination of methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and hybridization with comprehensive promoter arrays. We identify approximately 2,800 promoters that are hypomethylated in tumor samples. The hypomethylated promoters appear in clusters across the genome suggesting a high-level organization behind the epigenomic changes in cancer. The genes whose promoters are demethylated are mainly involved in cell growth, cell adhesion and communication, signal transduction, mobility and invasion; functions that are essential for cancer progression and metastasis. Previous studies suggested that MBD2 was involved in demethylation of uPA and MMP2 genes in human breast and prostate cancer cell lines. We extend these results here showing that whereas MBD2 depletion in normal liver cells has little or no effect, its depletion in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 and the adenocarcinoma cell line SkHep1 results in suppression of cell growth, anchorage-independent growth and invasiveness, as well as an increase in promoter methylation and silencing of several of the genes that are hypomethylated in tumors.

GSE2990,"Background: Histologic grade in breast cancer provides clinically important prognostic information. However, 30%-60% of tumors are classified as histologic grade 2. This grade is associated with an intermediate risk of recurrence and is thus not informative for clinical decision making. We examined whether histologic grade was associated with gene expression profi les of breast cancers and whether such profi les could be used to improve histologic grading.  Methods: We analyzed microarray data from 189 invasive breast carcinomas and from three published gene expression datasets from breast  carcinomas. We identified differentially expressed genes in a training set of 64 estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumor samples by comparing expression profiles between histologic grade 3 tumors and histologic grade 1 tumors and used the expression of these genes to define the gene expression grade index. Data from 597 independent tumors were used to evaluate the association between relapse-free survival and the gene expression grade index in a Kaplan-Meier analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results: We identified 97 genes in our training set that were associated with histologic grade; most of these genes were involved in cell cycle regulation and proliferation. In validation datasets, the gene expression grade index was strongly associated with histologic grade 1 and 3 status; however, among histologic grade 2 tumors, the index spanned the values for histologic grade 1-3 tumors. Among patients with histologic grade 2 tumors, a high gene expression grade index was associated with a higher risk of recurrence than a low gene expression grade index (hazard ratio = 3.61, 95% confidence interval = 2.25 to 5.78; P<.001, log-rank test).  Conclusions: Gene expression grade index appeared to reclassify patients with histologic grade 2 tumors into two groups with high versus low risks of recurrence. This approach may improve the accuracy of tumor grading and thus its prognostic value.   NB: The patients coming from Uppsala Hospital have been also used in other studies as in GSE3494.

GSE30174,"The etiology behind cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is currently unknown. The physiological mechanisms of CRF are based on limited evidence that genetic factors, energy expenditure, metabolism, aerobic capacity, and the individual's immune response to inflammation are responsible for the experience of CRF. Gene expression profiling using microarray analysis from white blood cells of men with non-metastatic prostate cancer shows significant, differential expression of 463 probesets during localized external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Pathway analysis shows a central role of SNCA (alpha-synuclein gene) among these differentially expressed probesets. Significant expression of SNCA was confirmed by qPCR (p<.001) and ELISA (p<.001) over time during EBRT. A significant correlation was noted between averaged fatigue scores and delta CT values of SNCA expression using confirmatory qPCR over time during EBRT (R=-.90, p=.006). Development of fatigue experienced by these men during EBRT may be mediated by SNCA expression.

GSE30219,"An unexplored consequence of epigenetic alterations associated with cancer is the ectopic expression of tissue-restricted genes. Here, a new strategy was developed to decipher genome-wide expression data in search for these “off-context” gene activations, which consisted first, in identifying a large number of tissue-specific genes normally epigenetically silenced in most somatic cells and second, in using them as cancer biomarkers on an “on/off” basis. Applying this concept to analyze whole-genome transcriptome data in lung cancer, we discovered a specific group of 26 genes whose expression was a strong and independent predictor of poor prognosis in our cohort of 293 lung tumours, as well as in two independent external populations. In addition, these 26 classifying genes enabled us to isolate a homogenous group of metastatic-prone highly aggressive tumours, whose characteristic gene expression profile revealed a high proliferative potential combined to a significant decrease in immune and signaling functions.

GSE31519,"Current prognostic gene expression profiles for breast cancer mainly reflect proliferation status and are most useful in ER-positive cancers. Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are clinically heterogeneous, and prognostic markers and biology-based therapies are needed to better treat this disease.  We assembled Affymetrix gene expression data for 579 TNBCs and performed unsupervised analysis to define metagenes that distinguish molecular subsets within TNBC. We used n=394 cases for discovery and n=185 cases for validation. Sixteen metagenes emerged that identified basal-like, apocrine and claudin-low molecular subtypes, or reflected various non-neoplastic cell populations including immune cells, blood, adipocytes, stroma, angiogenesis, and inflammation within the cancer. The expressions of these metagenes were correlated with survival and multivariate analysis was performed including routine clinical and pathological variables.  73% of TNBCs displayed basal-like molecular subtype that correlated with high histological grade and younger age. Survival of basal-like TNBC was not different from non-basal-like TNBC. High expression of immune cell metagenes was associated with good and high expression of inflammation and angiogenesis-related metagenes were associated with poor prognosis. A ratio of high B-cell and low IL-8 metagenes identified 32% of TNBC with good prognosis (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22-0.61; P<0.001) and was the only significant predictor in multivariate analysis including routine clincopathological variables.

GSE3167,"The presence of carcinoma in situ (CIS) lesions in the urinary bladder is associated with a high risk of disease progression to a muscle invasive stage. In this study, we used microarray expression profiling to examine the gene expression patterns in superficial transitional cell carcinoma (sTCC) with surrounding CIS (13 patients), without surrounding CIS lesions (15 patients), and in muscle invasive carcinomas (mTCC; 13 patients). Hierarchical cluster analysis separated the sTCC samples according to the presence or absence of CIS in the surrounding urothelium. We identified a few gene clusters that contained genes with similar expression levels in transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) with surrounding CIS and invasive TCC. However, no close relationship between TCC with adjacent CIS and invasive TCC was observed using hierarchical cluster analysis. Expression profiling of a series of biopsies from normal urothelium and urothelium with CIS lesions from the same urinary bladder revealed that the gene expression found in sTCC with surrounding CIS is found also in CIS biopsies as well as in histologically normal samples adjacent to the CIS lesions. Furthermore, we also identified similar gene expression changes in mTCC samples. We used a supervised learning approach to build a 16-gene molecular CIS classifier. The classifier was able to classify sTCC samples according to the presence or absence of surrounding CIS with a high accuracy. This study demonstrates that a CIS gene expression signature is present not only in CIS biopsies but also in sTCC, mTCC, and, remarkably, in histologically normal urothelium from bladders with CIS.

The methylation status of SCARA5 was subsequently investigated in 23 paired colorectal tissue samples; methylation was detected in 17%, respectively. Observed promoter methylation showed a tendency towards methylation in tumor-derived samples, in SCARA5 gene. Significant down expression of SCARA5 mRNA was observed in CRC cell lines and tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The use of genome-wide screening led to the identification of a group of candidate genes. Among them, SCARA5 was methylated and markedly down-regulated in CRC.

Luminal A, luminal B and HER2-enriched tumors showed a significantly lower GSTP1 positivity than basal-like tumors (P = 0.002, P < 0.001 and P = 0.009, respectively), while luminal A, luminal B and HER2-enriched tumors showed a higher GSTP1 MI than basal-like tumors (P = 0.076, P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In conclusion, these results suggest the possibility that GSTP1 expression can predict pathological response to P-FEC in ER-negative tumors but not in ER-positive tumors. Additionally, GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation might be implicated more importantly in the pathogenesis of luminal A, luminal B and HER2-enriched tumors than basal-like tumors.",GSTP1 expression predicts poor pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ER-negative breast cancer,570,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE32nnn/GSE32646/,,,,,Breast Cancer,,GSE32646,978,115,4,0.61971831

A concordant survival-based whole genome in silico array analysis of DNA copy number, and mRNA & micro RNA (miRNA) expression in 25 early stage PDAC was performed. A novel composite score simultaneously integrated gene expression with regulatory mechanisms to identify the signature genes with the most levels of prognosis-significant evidence.

GSE33658,"Endocrine therapy in patients with breast cancer can be limited by the problem of resistance. Preclinical studies suggest that complete blockade of the estrogen receptor (ER) combined with inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can overcome endocrine resistance. We tested this hypothesis in a phase II neoadjuvant trial of anastrozole and fulvestrant combined with gefitinib in postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed ER-positive breast cancer. After a baseline tumor core biopsy, patients were randomized to receive anastrozole and fulvestrant (AF) or anastrozole, fulvestrant, and gefitinib (AFG) for 3 weeks.  After a second biopsy at 3 weeks, all patients received AFG for 4 months and surgery was done if the tumor was operable. The primary endpoint was best clinical response by RECIST criteria and secondary endpoints were toxicity and change in biomarkers. The study closed after 15 patients were enrolled because of slow accrual. Median patient age was 67 years and median clinical tumor size was 7 cm. Four patients had metastatic disease present. Three patients withdrew before response was assessed. In the remaining twelve patients, there were two complete clinical responses (17%), three partial responses (25%), five had stable disease (41%), and two (17%) had progressive disease. Most common adverse events were rash in four patients, diarrhea in four, joint symptoms in three, and abnormal liver function tests in three. There were no grade 4 toxicities and all toxicities were reversible. At 3 weeks, cell proliferation as measured by Ki-67 was significantly reduced in the AFG group (p value= 0.01) with a parallel reduction in the expression of the Cyclin D1 (p value=0.02). RNA microarray data showed a corresponding decrease in the expression of cell cycle genes.

GSE35925,"Background: Breast cancer patients present lower 1,25(OH)2D3 or 25(OH)D3 serum levels than unaffected women. Although 1,25(OH)2D3 pharmacological concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3 may exert antiproliferative effects in breast cancer cell lines, much uncertainty remains about the effects of calcitriol supplementation in tumor specimens in vivo. We have evaluated tumor dimension (ultrassonography), proliferative index (Ki67 expression), 25(OH)D3 serum concentration and gene expression profile, before and after a short term calcitriol supplementation (dose to prevent osteoporosis) to post-menopausal patients. Results: Thirty three patients with operable disease had tumor samples evaluated. Most of them (87.5%) presented 25(OH)D3 insufficiency (<30 ng/mL). Median period of calcitriol supplementation was 30 days. Although tumor dimension did not vary, Ki67 immunoexpression decreased after supplementation. Transcriptional analysis of 15 matched pre/post-supplementation samples using U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix) revealed 18 genes over-expressed in post-supplementation tumors. As a technical validation procedure, expression of four genes was also determined by RT-qPCR and a direct correlation was observed between both methods (microarray vs PCR). To further explore the effects of near physiological concentrations of calcitriol on breast cancer samples, an ex vivo model of fresh tumor slices was utilized. Tumor samples from another 12 post-menopausal patients were sliced and treated in vitro with slightly high concentrations of calcitriol (0.5nM), that can be attained in vivo, for 24 hours In this model, expression of PBEF1, EGR1, ATF3, FOS and RGS1 was not induced after a short exposure to calcitriol. Conclusions: In our work, most post-menopausal breast cancer patients presented at least 25(OH)D3 insufficiency. In these patients, a short period of calcitriol supplementation may prevent tumor growth and reduce Ki67 expression, probably associated with discrete transcriptional changes.

The minimal amplified region encodes c-MYC and the non-coding RNA, PVT1 including miR-1204 encoded in exon 1b. Here we analyzed the genomic changes at chromosome 8q24.21 in breast cancer and the functional roles of miR-1204  in breast and ovarian cancer progression.  Methods: The genomic changes at chromosome 8q24.21 were detected in 997 breast cancer tumors and 40 breast cancer cell lines. Expression of miR-1204 in breast and ovarian cancer cell lines was investigated by qRT-PCR method. The role of miR-1204 in the tumorigenesis of breast and ovarian cancer was explored using both knockdown and overexpression of miR-1204 in vitro. Candidate miR-1204 target genes from two independent expression microarray datasets and computational predict programs were identified and further validated by qRT-PCR and western blot methods. The role of inhibition of miR-1204 on tamoxifen sensitivity in breast cancer cells was also investigated.  Results: MiR-1204 is frequently co-amplified with MYC and expression of miR-1204 is strongly correlated with the expression and amplification of the noncoding PVT1 transcript and less so with MYC in human breast and ovarian cancer cells. Inhibition of miR-1204 decreases cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in breast and ovarian cancer cell lines with 8q24 amplification, but not in lines without amplification and so may be involved in Myc-induced apoptosis. Additionally, overexpression of miR-1204 enhances both breast and ovarian cancer cell growth and Myc-initiated Rat1A cell transformation. Computational and experimental analyses 30 promising candidate miR-1204 target genes.  mRNA levels for these genes were  assessed after over expression and knockdown of miR-1204 as were protein levels for 10 genes for which antibodies were available. These studies implicated VDR and ESR1 as miR-1204 targets. Inhibition of miR-1204 increased response to tamoxifen in Estrogen Receptor negative breast cancer cell lines.

We used a panel of human PDAC cell lines, as well as patient-derived PDAC xenografts, to determine whether pharmacological targeting of the Notch pathway could inhibit pancreatic tumor growth and potentiate gemcitabine sensitivity.  In vitro, MRK-003 treatment downregulated the canonical Notch target gene Hes-1, significantly inhibited anchorage independent growth, and reduced the subset of CD44+CD24+ and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)+ cells that have been attributed with tumor initiating capacity.  Ex vivo pretreatment of PDAC cells with MRK-003 in culture significantly inhibited the subsequent engraftment in immunocompromised mice.  In vivo, MRK-003 monotherapy significantly blocked tumor growth in 5 of 9 (56%) patient-derived PDAC xenografts.  Moreover, a combination of MRK-003 and gemcitabine showed enhanced antitumor effects compared to gemcitabine alone in 4 of 9 (44%) PDAC xenografts. Baseline gene expression analysis of the treated xenografts indicated that upregulation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) pathway components was associated with the sensitivity to single MRK-003, while upregulation in B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (NRF2) pathway correlated with response to the combination of MRK-003 with gemcitabine. The preclinical findings presented here provide further rationale for small molecule inhibition of Notch signaling as a therapeutic strategy in PDAC.

GSE37745,"Background: Global gene expression profiling has been widely used in lung cancer research to identify clinically relevant molecular subtypes as well as to predict prognosis and therapy response. So far, the value of these multi-gene signatures in clinical practice is unclear and the biological importance of individual genes is difficult to assess as the published signatures virtually do not overlap.  Methods: Here we describe a novel single institute cohort, including 196 non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) cases with clinical information and long-term follow-up, which was used as a training set to screen for single genes with prognostic impact. The top 450 gene probe sets identified using a univariate Cox regression model (significance level p<0.01) were tested in a meta-analysis including five publicly available independent lung cancer cohorts (n=860).  Results: The meta-analysis revealed that 17 probe sets were significantly associated with survival (p<0.0005) with a false discovery rate of 1%. The prognostic impact of one of these genes, the cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1), was confirmed by use of immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray including 355 NSCLC samples. Low CADM1 protein expression was associated with shorter survival (p=0.028), with particular influence in the adenocarcinoma patient subgroup (p=0.002).  Conclusions: We were able to validate single genes with independent prognostic impact using a novel NSCLC cohort together with a meta-analysis approach.

GSE37964,"The LEF/TCF family of transcription factors are downstream effectors of the WNT signaling pathway, which drives colon tumorigenesis.  LEF/TCFs have a DNA sequence-specific HMG box that binds Wnt Response Elements (WREs).  The “E tail” isoforms of TCFs are alternatively spliced to include a second DNA binding domain called the C-clamp.  We show that induction of a dominant negative C-clamp version of TCF1 (dnTCF1E) induces a p21-dependent stall in the growth of DLD1 colon cancer cells.  Induction of a C-clamp mutant did not induce p21 or stall cell growth.  Microarray analysis revealed that induction of p21 by dnTCF1EWT correlated with a decrease in expression of p21 suppressors that act at multiple levels from transcription (SP5, YAP1, RUNX1), to RNA stability (MSI2), and protein stability (CUL4A).  We show that the C-clamp is a sequence specific DNA binding domain that can make contacts with 5’-RCCG-3’ elements upstream or downstream of WREs.

GSE38832,"Colorectal carcinoma is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. In order to understand the mechanism/signaling pathways responsible for invasion, migration and metastasis in colorectal cancer, we developed an integrative and comparative genetic approach to infer transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying colon cancer progression.   Accordingly, we filtered fourteen human colorectal cancer (CRC) microarray data sets, from an immune competent mouse model of metastasis to identify known and novel transcriptional regulators in CRC. Using this approach, Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors were identified as metastasis driver of colon cancer.  NFAT family of transcription factors  is known to induce gene transcription in various disease processes, including carcinogenesis. We used parental and metastatic derivatives of MC38 mouse colon cancer cells (MC38Par and MC38Met, respectively) to evaluate the role of NFATc1 in cancer cell invasiveness.  We found that high NFATc1 expression correlates with significantly increased (p<0.0001) Trans-Endothelial Invasion (TEI) in MC38Met cells. Conversely, RNAi-based inhibition of NFATc1 expression and functional inhibition with calcineurin inhibitor FK506 in MC38Met cells, both resulted in significant decreased TEI (p=0.0193 & p=0.0003). Furthermore, a set of  predicted NFATc1 target mRNAs identified in our original analysis were downregulated by knock-down of NFATc1 or functional inhibition with FK506 in MC38Met cells.  The expression level (mRNA) of predicted gene targets were high in human CRC specimens which had higher than median NFATc1 mRNA expression (n=11 out of total 22). The tumor-associated NFATc1 co-regulated gene signature is significantly correlated with both disease-specific and disease-free survival in Stage II and III CRC patients.

Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) is known to suppress immune system and to be an unfavorable prognostic factor in ovarian cancer.

Microarray profiles of cytology-positive cases showed significant correlations with Gene Ontology terms related to immune system process. Microarray and immunohistochemistry in human ovarian cancer revealed significant correlation between PD-L1 expression and positive cytology. PD-L1 expression on mouse ovarian cancer cells was induced upon encountering lymphocytes in the course of peritoneal spread in vivo and upon co-culturing with lymphocytes in vitro. Tumor cell lysis by CTLs was attenuated when PD-L1 was overexpressed and promoted when it was silenced. PD-L1 overexpression also inhibited gathering and degranulation of CTLs.

GSE40654,"PURPOSE:  Previous mouse studies using corn oil (ω-6) as the dietary fat source suggest that decreasing dietary fat content can slow prostate cancer (PCa) growth.  However, other studies, in which the diet was composed around saturated fat, showed no difference in outcomes between high-fat and low-fat diets.  The relative effects of other fats, such as fish oil and olive oil, also remain unexplored.  To our knowledge, no trial has yet compared the effect of various fats on prostate cancer progression.  Therefore, we sought to systematically study the effect of fish oil, olive oil, corn oil, and saturated fat on prostate cancer progression.  METHODS:  A total of 96 male SCID mice were injected with LAPC-4 human PCa cells.  Two weeks following injection, mice were singly-housed and randomized to either a fish oil, olive oil, corn oil, or saturated fat based diet.  Animals were euthanized when tumors reached 1,000 mm3.  Serum was collected at sacrifice and assayed for PSA, insulin, IGF-1, IGFBP-3, and PGE-2 levels.  Tumors were also assayed for PGE-2, and COX-2 levels, and gene array analysis was performed.  RESULTS:  Mice weights and tumor volumes were equivalent across groups at randomization.  Overall, fish-oil consumption was associated with improved survival, relative to all other dietary groups (Log-rank, all p<0.05).  We did not detect any significant difference in serum PSA, insulin, IGF-1, IGFBP-3, and PGE-2 levels.  Glucose at the time of sacrifice was statistically different between groups, with the fish-oil fed mice having the highest levels of serum glucose (Kruskal-Wallis, p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS:  In this prostate cancer xenograft model, we found that consuming a diet in which fish-oil was the only fat source slowed tumor growth in improved survival, compared to mice consuming diets composed of olive oil, corn oil, or saturated fat sources.

We elongated telomeres of human prostate cancer PC-3 cells, which possess short telomeres7, by enhancing their telomerase activity. The resulting cells with long telomeres retain an ability to form tumors in a mouse xenograft model. Strikingly, these tumors exhibit many duct-like structures and reduced N-cadherin expression, reminiscent of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma.

Stability of the model was validated in two independent data sets.  To test the capacity of our model to predict patient response to specific targeted therapies and to determine the sensitivity of the subgroups to chemotherapy in vivo, we treated patient-derived colorectal cancer explants (PDCCEs) predicted to have high mTOR pathway activity with everolimus or oxaliplatin. Results: A molecular profile of the discovery dataset revealed 8 molecular subgroups of colorectal cancer (MSCC).

GSE41627,"The cellular response to DNA damage is mediated through multiple pathways that regulate and coordinate DNA repair, cell cycle arrest  and cell death. We show that the DNA damage response (DDR) induced by ionizing radiation (IR) is coordinated in breast cancer  cells by selective mRNA translation mediated by high levels of translation initiation factor eIF4G1. Increased expression of eIF4G1,  common in breast cancers, was found to selectively increase translation of mRNAs involved in cell survival and the DDR, preventing  autophagy and apoptosis (Survivin, HIF1α, XIAP), promoting cell cycle arrest (GADD45a, p53, ATRIP, Chk1) and DNA repair (53BP1,  BRCA1/2, PARP, Rfc2-5, ATM, MRE-11, others). Reduced expression of eIF4G1, but not its homolog eIF4G2, greatly sensitizes cells to  DNA damage by IR, induces cell death by both apoptosis and autophagy, and significantly delays resolution of DNA damage foci  with little reduction of overall protein synthesis. While some mRNAs selectively translated by higher levels of eIF4G1 were found  to use internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated alternate translation, most do not. The latter group shows significantly reduced  dependence on eIF4E for translation, facilitated by an enhanced requirement for eIF4G1.

Results: Significant overexpression of collagen IV, lipocalin-2, caveolin-1, calumenin genes, and significant dowregulation of aquaporin-8, amnionless homolog, prostaglandin D2 receptor genes were detected in CRC patients compared to normal. Adenoma samples were characterized by upregulated CD44 antigen, met proto-oncogene and downregulated chemokine ligand-12, ADAM-like decysin-1 and ATP-binding casette A8 discriminatory genes. In IBD samples significantly increased lipocalin-2, interferon induced transmembrane protein 1 and 3 mRNA levels, decreased zinc finger protein 91 and transient receptor potential cation channel M6 mRNA levels were found. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease can be distinguished  according to the top five genes: cyclin-G2; tripartite motif-containing-31; TNFR shedding aminopeptidase regulator-1; C-type lectin superfamily member-14 and AMICA. 88.3-97.8% of  the cases was correctly classified according to discriminatory genes.  Conclusions: Our whole genomic microarray analysis of biopsy samples provides discriminative signatures, and an insight into pathophysiological background of colonic diseases.

GSE44408,"  Lymph node involvement is a major prognostic variable in breast cancer. Whether the molecular mechanisms that drive breast cancer cells to colonize lymph nodes are shared with their capacity to form distant metastases is yet to be established. In a transcriptomic survey aimed at identifying molecular factors associated with lymph node involvement of ductal breast cancer, we found that luminal differentiation, assessed by the expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) and GATA3, was only infrequently lost in node-positive primary tumors and in matched lymph node metastases. The transcription factor GATA3 critically determines luminal lineage specification of mammary epithelium and is widely considered a tumor and metastasis suppressor in breast cancer. Strong expression of GATA3 and ER in a majority of primary node-positive ductal breast cancer was corroborated by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry in the initial sample set, and by immunohistochemistry in an additional set from 167 patients diagnosed of node-negative and –positive primary infiltrating ductal breast cancer, including 102 samples from loco-regional lymph node metastases matched to their primary tumors, as well as 37 distant metastases.

GSE45626,"Insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 (IGF-1R) inhibition could be a relevant therapeutic approach in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) given the importance of an IGF-1R autocrine loop and its role in DNA damage repair processes. We assessed IGF-1R and pAkt protein expression in 83 SCLC human specimens. The efficacy of R1507 (a monoclonal antibody directed against IGF-1R) alone or combined with cisplatin or ionizing radiation (IR) was evaluated in H69, H146 and H526 cells in vitro and in vivo. Innovative genomic and functional approaches were conducted to analyze the molecular behavior under the different treatment conditions. A total of 53% and 37% of human specimens expressed IGF-1R and pAkt, respectively. R1507 demonstrated single agent activity in H146 and H526 cells but not in H69 cells. R1507 exhibited synergistic effects with both Cisplatin and IR in vitro. The triple combination R1507-Cisplatin-IR led to a dramatic delay in tumor growth compared to Cisplatin-IR in H526 cells. Analyzing the apparent absence of antitumoral effect of R1507 alone in vivo, we observed a transient reduction of IGF-1R staining intensity in vivo, concomitant to the activation of multiple cell surface receptors and intracellular proteins involved in proliferation, angiogenesis and survival. Finally, we identified that the nucleotide excision repair pathway (NER) was mediated after exposure to R1507-CDDP and R1507-IR in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, adding R1507 to the current standard Cisplatin-IR doublet reveals remarkable chemo- and radiosensitizing effects in selected SCLC models and warrants to be investigated in the clinical setting.

GSE46106,"Breast cancer research is hampered by difficulties in obtaining and studying primary human breast tissue, and by the lack of in vivo preclinical models that reflect patient tumor biology accurately. To overcome these limitations, we propagated a cohort of human breast tumors grown in the epithelium-free mammary fat pad of SCID/Beige and NOD/SCID/IL2γ-receptor null (NSG) mice, under a series of transplant conditions.  Both models yielded stably transplantable xenografts at comparably high rates (~23% and ~19%, respectively). Of the conditions tested, xenograft take rate was highest in the presence of a low-dose estradiol pellet. Overall, 32 stably transplantable xenograft lines were established, representing unique 25 patients. Most tumors yielding xenografts were “triple-negative” (ER-PR-HER2+) (n=19). However, we established lines from three ER-PR-HER2+ tumors, one ER+PR-HER2-, one ER+PR+HER2- and one “triple-positive” (ER+PR+HER2+) tumor. Serially passaged xenografts show biological consistency with the tumor of origin, are phenotypic stability across multiple transplant generations at the histological, transcriptomic, proteomic, and genomic levels, and show comparable treatment responses.

GSE46222,"Unlike many other cancers, estrogen receptor-alpha (ER+) breast cancers are associated with cumulative risks of recurrence and death that persist for decades. We show that molecular differences between breast cancers that recur at distant sites early (² 3 years) or late (³ 5 years) support a robust molecular predictor of recurrence with Tamoxifen therapy and provide novel insights into the signaling features that differ between these recurrent cancers. We applied a support vector machine with recursive feature elimination to gene expression microarray data using a training-internal crossvalidation workflow that minimizes the gene selection bias problem. The resulting predictor was validated in an independent data set. Performance of the predictor suggests that it is possible to identify patients at increased risk of experiencing an early recurrence who require other treatments to prevent early metastasis. We implemented a Metropolis Sampling algorithm as a random walk to identify the protein-protein interactions (PPI) most closely associated with ER in 8 PPI databases. We then walked the gene expression data for the top PPIs to discover a signaling network driving early and late recurrent breast cancers. Consensus features between the training and validation datasets define a complex and highly connected network with major interactions among nodes including AR, CALD1, CALM(1,2,3), CDK1, EGFR, ESR1, ESR2, MAPK1, and SRC. The complexity illustrates the challenges in directing single agent or simple combination therapies to improve overall survival in ER+ breast cancers that will recur but also suggests potentially novel interventions to address this challenge.",Molecular signaling distinguishes early from late recurrences in ER positive breast cancer,570,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE46nnn/GSE46222/,,,,,Breast Cancer,,GSE46222,978,49,1,0.416666667

GSE46928,"Gene Expression Profiling of Breast Cancer Patients with Brain Metastases  Brain metastases confer the worst prognosis of breast cancer as no therapy exists that prevents or eliminates the cancer from spreading to the brain. We developed a new computational modeling method to derive specific downstream signaling pathways that reveal unknown target-disease connections and new mechanisms for specific cancer subtypes. The model enables us to reposition drugs based on available gene expression data of patients. We applied this model to repurpose known or shelved drugs for brain, lung, and bone metastases of breast cancer with the hypothesis that cancer subtypes have their own specific signaling mechanisms. To test the hypothesis, we addressed the specific CSBs for each metastasis that satisfy that (1) CSB proteins are activated by the maximal number of enriched signaling pathways specific to this metastasis, and (2) CSB proteins involve in the most differential expressed coding-genes specific to the specific breast cancer metastasis. The identified signaling networks for the three types of metastases contain 31, 15, and 18 proteins, respectively, and are used to reposition 15, 9, and 2 drug candidates for the brain, lung, and bone metastases of breast cancer.

In the current study, genes concurrently identified in array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and gene expression microarrays were used to derive gene signatures for Han Chinese breast cancers.   We performed 23 array CGHs and 81 gene expression microarrays in breast cancer samples from Taiwanese women. Genes with coherent patterns of both CNV and differential gene expression were identified from the 21 samples assayed using both platforms. We used these genes to derive signatures associated with clinical ER and HER2 status and disease-free survival.   Distributions of signature genes were strongly associated with chromosomal location: chromosome 16 for ER and 17 for HER2. A breast cancer risk predictive model was built based on the first supervised principal component from 16 genes (RCAN3, MCOLN2, DENND2D, RWDD3, ZMYM6, CAPZA1, GPR18, WARS2, TRIM45, SCRN1, CSNK1E, HBXIP, CSDE1, MRPL20, IKZF1, and COL20A1), and distinct survival patterns were observed between the high- and low-risk groups from the combined dataset of 408 microarrays. The risk score was significantly higher in breast cancer patients with recurrence, metastasis, or mortality than in relapse-free individuals (0.241 versus 0, P<0.001). The concurrent gene risk predictive model remained discriminative across distinct clinical ER and HER2 statuses in subgroup analysis.

Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate three year overall survival probabilities and the prognostic effect of the classifier was assessed using log-rank testing. Cox proportional hazards model evaluated the signature's effect adjusting for clinical prognostic factors. Results: Expression data of the 15-gene classifier stratified UHN181 cases into high and low-risk subgroups with significantly different overall survival (HR=1.92, 95% CI: 1.15-3.23, p=0.012). Its strength as a prognostic classifier was superior to stage alone (HR=1.52, 95% CI: 0.90-2.55, p-value=0.11). In subgroup analysis, this classifier predicted survival in 127 Stage I patients (HR=2.17, 95% CI: 1.12-4.20, p=0.018) and the smaller subgroup of 48 Stage IA patients (HR=5.61, 95% CI: 1.19-26.45, p=0.014. The signature was prognostic for both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma cases (HR= 1.76, p-value=0.058; HR= 4.19, p-value=0.045, respectively). Conclusions: The prognostic accuracy of a 15-gene classifier was validated in an independent cohort of 181 early stage NSCLC samples including Stage IA cases and in different NSCLC histologic subtypes.","Validation of a histology-independent prognostic gene signature for early stage, non-small cell lung cancer including stage IA patients",570,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE50nnn/GSE50081/,,,,,Lung Cancer ,,GSE50081,978,181,5,0.70754717
GSE50567,"We have analyzed, using DNA microarrays, putative differences in gene-expression level between hereditary BRCA1 mutation-linked and sporadic breast cancer. Our results show that a previously reported marked difference between BRCA1-mutation linked and sporadic breast cancer was probably due to uneven stratification of samples with different ER status and basal-like versus luminal-like subtype. We observed that apparent difference between BRCA1-linked and other types of breast cancer found in univariate analysis was diminished when data were corrected for ER status and molecular subtype in multivariate analyses. In fact, the difference in gene expression pattern of BRCA1-mutated and sporadic cancer is very discrete. These conclusions were supported by the results of Q-PCR validation. We also found that BRCA1 gene inactivation due to promoter hypermethylation had similar effect on general gene expression profile as mutation-induced protein truncation. This suggests that in the molecular studies of hereditary breast cancer, BRCA1 gene methylation should be recognized and considered together with gene mutation.",BRCA1-related gene signature in breast cancer: the role of ER status and molecular type,570,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE50nnn/GSE50567/,,,,,Breast Cancer,,GSE50567,978,41,1,0.272727273
GSE50705,"Transcriptome analysis of MCF-7 cells exposed for 48 hours to various concentrations of xenoestrogen chemicals. Although biological effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are often observed at unexpectedly low doses with occasional non-monotonic dose-response characteristics, transcriptome-wide profiles of sensitivities or dose-dependent behaviors of the EDC responsive genes have remained unexplored. Here, we describe expressome analysis for the comprehensive examination of dose-dependent gene responses and its applications to characterize estrogen responsive genes in MCF-7 cells. Transcriptomes of MCF-7 cells exposed to varying concentrations of representative natural and xenobiotic estrogens for 48 hours were determined by microarray and used for computational calculation of interpolated approximations of estimated transcriptomes for 300 doses uniformly distributed in log space for each chemical. The entire collection of these estimated transcriptomes, designated as the expressome, has provided unique opportunities to profile chemical-specific distributions of ligand sensitivities for large numbers of estrogen responsive genes, revealing that at low concentrations estrogens generally tended to suppress rather than to activate transcription. Gene ontology analysis demonstrated distinct functional enrichment between high- and low-sensitivity estrogen responsive genes, supporting the notion that a single EDC chemical can cause qualitatively distinct biological responses at different doses. Expressomal heatmap visualization of dose-dependent induction of Bisphenol A-inducible genes showed a weak gene activation peak at a very low concentration range (ca. 0.1 nM) in addition to the main, strong gene activation peak at and above 100 nM. Thus, expressome analysis is a powerful approach to understanding the EDC dose-dependent dynamic changes in gene expression at the transcriptomal level, providing important information on the overall profiles of ligand sensitivities and non-monotonic responses.",Xenoestrogen Dose-dependent Transcriptomal Changes in MCF-7 Human Breast Cancer Cells,570,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE50nnn/GSE50705/,,,,,Breast Cancer,,GSE50705,978,351,1,0.238636364

GSE51021,"Lymph node metastasis is a poor prognosis indicator in esophageal cancer. Although tumor spreading currently forms the main basis for therapy selection, the molecular mechanisms underlying the metastatic pathway remain insufficiently understood. Several studies aimed to investigate these mechanisms but focused mainly on regulatory patterns in the tumors themselves and/or the invaded lymph nodes. To date no study has yet investigated the potential changes on transcription level, which take place within the yet non-invaded niche. Here we provide a comprehensive description of these regulations in patients.  In this study the transcriptomic profiles of regional lymph nodes were determined for two patient groups: patients classified as pN1 (metastasis) or pN0 (no metastasis) respectively. All investigated lymph nodes, also those from pN1 patients, were still free of metastasis. The gene expression data was obtained via microarray analysis. Top candidates were validated via PCR and immunohistochemistry.   The results show that regional lymph nodes of pN1 patients differ decisively from those of pN0 patients – even before metastasis has taken place. In the pN0 group distinct immune response patterns were observed. In contrast, lymph nodes of the pN1 group exhibited a clear profile of reduced immune response and reduced proliferation, but increased apoptosis, enhanced hypoplasia and morphological conversion processes. DKK1 was the most significant gene associated with the molecular mechanisms taking place in lymph nodes of patients suffering from metastasis (pN1). We assume that the two molecular profiles observed constitute two different stages of a progressive disease. Finally we suggest that DKK1 might play an important role within the mechanisms leading to lymph node metastasis.",DKK1 expression is down-regulated in the lymph node pre-metastatic niche in esophageal cancer,570,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE51nnn/GSE51021/,,,,,Esophageal Cancer,,GSE51021,978,28,2,0.555555556

GSE51373,"Background: Resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy remains a major impediment in the treatment of serous epithelial ovarian cancer. The objective of this study was to use gene expression profiling to delineate major deregulated pathways and biomarkers associated with the development of intrinsic chemotherapy resistance upon exposure to standard first-line therapy for ovarian cancer.   Methods: The study cohort comprised 28 patients divided into two groups based on their varying sensitivity to first-line chemotherapy using progression free survival (PFS) as a surrogate of response. All 28 patients had advanced stage, high-grade serous ovarian cancer, and were treated with the same standard platinum-based chemotherapy. Twelve patient tumors demonstrating relative resistance to platinum chemotherapy corresponding to shorter PFS (< eight months) were compared to sixteen tumors from platinum-sensitive patients (PFS > eighteen months). Whole transcriptome profiling was performed using a Affymetrix high-resolution microarray platform to permit global comparisons of gene expression profiles between tumors from the resistant group and the sensitive group.   Results: Microarray data analysis revealed a set of 204 discriminating genes possessing expression levels, which could influence differential chemotherapy response between the two groups. Robust statistical testing was then performed which eliminated a dependence on the normalization algorithm employed, producing a restricted list of differentially regulated genes, and which found IGF1 to be the most strongly differentially expressed gene. Pathway analysis, based on the list of 204 genes, revealed enrichment in genes primarily involved in the IGF1/PI3K/NFκB/ERK gene signalling networks.   Conclusions: This study has identified pathway specific prognostic biomarkers possibly underlying a differential chemotherapy response in patients undergoing standard platinum-based treatment of serous epithelial ovarian cancer.

Amino acid exchanges in these two motifs impair binding of Bag-1L to the AR but increase the androgen-dependent activation of a subset of AR-target genes. We have therefore identified GARRPR as a novel BF-3 regulatory sequence important for fine-tuning the activity of the receptor.,LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines overexpressing wild-type or GARRPR-mutant Bag-1L,570,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE51nnn/GSE51524/,,,,,Prostate Cancer,,GSE51524,978,18,2,1

Alterations in five pathways important for immune modulation and lymphoid structure development (TH17/Treg, NFkB, Ubiquitin-proteasome, Chemokines/chemokine receptors, and Integrins/adhesion molecules) in vaccine-induced intratumoral lymphoid aggregates were associated with improved post-vaccination responses.

These breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) mediate metastasis and by virtue of their resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, contribute to relapse.  Although several BCSC markers have been described, it is unclear whether these markers identify the same or independent BCSC populations. Based on established breast cancer cell lines, as well as primary tumor samples and xenografts, we show that BCSCs exist in distinct mesenchymal-like (epithelial-mesenchymal transition, EMT) and epithelial-like (mesenchymal-epithelial transition, MET) states characterized by expression of distinct markers, proliferative capacity and invasive characteristics. The gene expression profiles of mesenchymal-like and epithelial-like BCSCs are remarkably similar across the different molecular subtypes of breast cancer and resemble those of distinct basal and luminal stem cells found in the normal breast. We propose that the plasticity of BCSCs allowing them to transition between EMT- and MET-like states endows these cells with the capacity for tissue invasion, dissemination and growth at metastatic sites.",Expression data of ALDH+ breast cancer cells,570,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE52nnn/GSE52327/,,,,,Breast Cancer,,GSE52327,978,16,1,1
GSE52712,"Accurate profiling of RNA expression of single cells is a valuable approach for broadening our understanding of cancer biology and mechanisms of dissemination, but requires the development of reliable methods for their molecular characterization. Here we evaluate a single cell methodology which generates microgram amounts of cDNA suitable for next generation sequencing (RNA-Seq), high throughput RT-qPCR and Affymetrix array analysis. The approach was tested by comparing expression profiles of amplified single MCF7 and MCF10A cells to profiles generated from unamplified RNA. The expression profiles were compared by Affymetrix-U133 arrays, RNA-Seq and high-density qPCR.  There were strong cross-platform correlations of >80% and concordance between single cell and unamplified material of >70%.

GSE5787,"Purpose: To explore intratumor heterogeneity in gene expression profiles from patients with cervical cancer.  Experimental Design: A total of 33 biopsies were obtained from 11 patients, sampling between two and five different areas for each tumor.The extracted RNAwas hybridized onto the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 oligonucleotide chip. The variance of expression within a patient (W), between patients (B) and the total variance (T =W + B) were calculated for each ProbeSet, and the ratio W/T was used as a measure of intratumor heterogeneity. Gene Ontology functional analysis was done to assess the function of genes that had high W/T (top 10%) and low W/T (bottom 10%) values.  Results: In total, 448 ProbeSets (2.2% of the total) had W/T < 0.10, indicating low intratumor heterogeneity, and 537 ProbeSets (2.7% of the total) had W/T > 0.90, indicating high intratumor heterogeneity. In total 14,473 ProbeSets (72.4%) had higher intertumor than intratumor heterogeneity (W/T < 0.5). Genes with low intratumor heterogeneity were characterized by a statistically significant enrichment of immune-related functions (P < 0.0001). Genes with high intratumor heterogeneity were characterized by a significant tendency towards nuclear localization and nucleic acid binding (both P < 0.0001). For genes with W/T > 0.5, more than six biopsies would be required to minimize the intratumoral heterogeneity to <0.15; if W/T is 0.3 to 0.4, four biopsies are required; and for low W/T of 0.16 to 0.3, only two to three biopsies would be needed.  Conclusion: Although the intratumor heterogeneity was low for the majority of the tested ProbeSets, for many genes, multiple biopsies are required to obtain a reliable estimate of gene expression.

GSE5816,"Abstract Background:  Promoter hypermethylation coupled with loss of heterozygosity at the same locus results in loss of gene function in many tumor cells.  The “rules” governing which genes are methylated during the pathogenesis of individual cancers, how specific methylation profiles are initially established, or what determines tumor-type specific methylation are unknown.  However, DNA methylation markers that are highly specific and sensitive for common tumors would be useful for the early detection of cancer, and those required for the malignant phenotype identify pathways important as therapeutic targets.   Methods and Findings: In an effort to identify new cancer-specific methylation markers, we employed a high throughput global expression profiling approach in lung cancer cells.  We identified 132 genes that have 5’ CpG islands, are induced from undetectable levels by 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (5-aza) in multiple non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, and are expressed in immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells.  As expected, these genes were also expressed in normal lung, but often not in companion primary lung cancers.  Methylation analysis of a subset (45/132) of these promoter regions in primary lung cancer (N=20) and adjacent non-malignant tissue showed that 31 genes had acquired methylation in the tumors, but did not show methylation in normal lung or lymphocytes.  We studied the eight most frequently and specifically methylated genes from our lung cancer data set in breast cancer (N=37), colon cancer (N=24), and prostate cancer (N=24) along with counterpart non-malignant tissues.  We found that seven loci were frequently methylated in both breast and lung cancers, with four showing extensive methylation in all four epithelial tumors.   Conclusions: By using a systematic biological screen we identified multiple genes that are methylated with high penetrance in primary lung, breast, colon, and prostate cancers.  The cross-tumor methylation pattern we observed for these novel markers suggests that we have identified a partial promoter hypermethylation signature for these common malignancies.  These data suggest that while tumors in different tissues vary substantially with respect to gene expression, there may be commonalities in their promoter methylation profiles that represent potential targets for early detection screening or therapeutic intervention.

GSE58792,"Background   There are conflicting reports on the impact of soy on breast carcinogenesis. This study examines the effects of soy supplementation on breast cancer-related genes and pathways.  Methods   Women (n = 140) with early-stage breast cancer were randomized to soy protein supplementation (n = 70) or  placebo (n = 70) for 7 to 30 days, from diagnosis until surgery. Adherence was determined by plasma isoflavones:  genistein and daidzein. Gene expression changes were evaluated by NanoString inin pre- and post-treatment  tumor tissue. Genome-wide expression analysis was performed on post-treatment tissue. Proliferation (Ki67) and  apoptosis (Cas3) were assessed by immunohistochemistry.  Results   Plasma isoflavones rose in the soy group (two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P < .001) and did not change in  the placebo group. In paired analysis of pre- and post-treatment samples, 21 genes (out of 202) showed altered  expression (two-sided Student’s t-test, P < .05). Several genes including FANCC and UGT2A1 revealed different  magnitude and direction of expression changes between the two groups (two-sided Student’s t-test, P < .05).  A high-genistein signature consisting of 126 differentially expressed genes was identified from microarray analysis  of tumors. This signature was characterized by overexpression (>2 fold) of cell cycle transcripts, including  those which promote cell proliferation, such as FGFR2, E2F5, BUB1, CCNB2, MYBL2, CDK1, and CDC20 (P < .01).  Soy intake did not result in statistically significant changes in Ki67 or Cas3.  Conclusions   Gene expression associated with soy intake and high plasma genistein define a signature characterized by overexpression  of FGFR2 and genes that drive cell cycle and proliferation pathways. These findings raise the concerns  that in a subset of women soy could adversely affect gene expression in breast cancer.",Effects of soy supplementation on gene expression in breast cancer,570,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE58nnn/GSE58792/,,,,,Breast Cancer,,GSE58792,978,51,3,0.961538462
GSE58812,"Triple-negative (TN) breast cancers need to be refined in order to identify therapeutic subgroups of patients.  We conducted an unsupervised analysis of microarray gene-expression profiles of 107 TN breast cancer patients and undertook robust functional annotation of the molecular entities found by means of numerous approaches including immunohistochemistry and gene-expression signatures. An 87 TN external cohort was used for validation. Fuzzy clustering separated TN tumours into three clusters: C1 (22.4%), C2 (44.9%) and C3 (32.7%). C1 patients were older (mean = 64.6 years) than C2 (mean = 56.8 years; P = 0.03) and C3 patients (mean = 51.9 years; P = 0.0004). Histological grade and Nottingham prognostic index were higher in C2 and C3 than in C1 (P < 0.0001 for both comparisons). Significant event-free survival (EFS) (P = 0.03) was found according to cluster membership: patients belonging to C3 had a better outcome than patients in C1 (P = 0.01) and C2 (P = 0.02). EFS analysis results were confirmed when our cohort was pooled with external cohort (n = 194; P = 0.01). Functional annotation showed that 22% of TN patients were not basal-like (C1). C1 was enriched in luminal subtypes and positive androgen receptor (luminal androgen receptor [LAR]). C2 could be considered as an almost pure basal-like cluster. C3, enriched in basal-like subtypes, but to a lesser extent, included 26% of claudin-low subtypes. Dissection of immune response showed that high immune response (HIR) and low M2-like macrophages were a hallmark of C3, and that these patients had a better EFS than C2 patients, characterized by low immune response (LIR) and high M2-like macrophages: P = 0.02 for our cohort, and P = 0.03 for pooled cohorts.  We identified 3 subtypes of TN patients: LAR (22%), basal-like with LIR and high M2-like macrophages (45%) and basal-enriched with HIR and low M2-like macrophages (33%). We pointed out that macrophages and other immune effectors offer a variety of therapeutic targets in breast cancer, and particularly in TN basal-like tumours.

GSE59196,"The goal of the study was to evaluate the influence of mutations in MLK4 on the protein function and the process of tumorigenesis in colorectal cancers. Biochemical data imply that a majority of MLK4 mutations in colon cancer are loss-of-function, including, E314K and Y330H mutations. Two colorectal cell lines, HCT15 and HT115, harboring MLK4 loss-of-function mutations, Y330H and E314K respectively, were used in the study. To evaluate the consequences of loss-of-function MLK4 mutations in those colon cancer cell lines, HCT15 and HT115 cell lines were generated where expression of MLK4-WT (in HCT15 and HT115 cell lines) or MLK4-Y330H (in HCT15 cells) or MLK4-E314K (in HT115 cells) can be induced by tetracycline. The reconstitution of MLK4-WT in colon cancer cells reduced viability, proliferation and ability to form colonies as well as significantly slowed down the tumor growth in mouse xenografts. To investigate the downstream effectors of MLK4 that mediate the above effects, we transcriptionally profiled colon cancer cell lines after MLK4-WT reconstitution. The data indicates that re-expression of functional MLK4 leads to reduction in cell proliferation, likely due to increased expression of cJUN and cdk inhibitors (p15 or p21).",Frequent Loss-of-Function Mutations in MLK4 Suppresses Signaling in the JNK-cJUN-p21/p15 Pathway to Promote Growth of Colon Cancer Cells,570,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE59nnn/GSE59196/,,,,,Colorectal Cancer,,GSE59196,978,24,3,0.5
GSE59732,"Introduction: Breast radiotherapy is currently “one size fits all” regardless of breast cancer subtype (eg. luminal, basal). However, recent clinical data suggests that radiation response may vary significantly among subtypes.  Therefore, current practice leads to over- or under-treatment of women whose tumors are more or less radiation responsive.  We hypothesized that this clinical variability may be due, in part, to differences in cellular radiation response. Methods: We exposed 16 biologically-diverse breast tumor cell lines to 0 or 5GY radiation. Microarray analysis was performed on RNA harvested from those cell lines.  Samples were run in triplicate. Following quality assessment, differential gene expression analysis was performed using a two-way multiplicative linear mixed-effects model.  A candidate radiation response biomarkers with  biologically plausible role in radiation response, were identified and confirmed at the RNA and protein level with qPCR and Western blotting assays.  Induction in human breast tumors was confirmed in 32 patients with paired pre- and post-radiation tumor samples using IHC and microarray analysis.

GSE6044,"Lung cancers are a heterogeneous group of diseases with respect to biology and clinical behavior. So far, diagnosis and classification are based on histological morphology and immunohistological methods for discrimination between two main histologic groups: small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer which account for 20% and 80% of lung carcinomas, respectively. While SCLCs express properties of neuroendocrine cells, NSCLCs, which are divided into the three major subtypes adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and dedifferentiated large cell carcinoma, show different characteristics such as the expression of certain keratins or production of mucin and lack neuroedocrine differentiation. The molecular pathogenesis of lung cancer involves the accumulation of genetic und epigenetic alterations including the activation of proto-oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes which are different for lung cancer subgroups. The development of microarray technologies opened up the possibility to quantify the expression of a large number of genes simultaneously in a given sample. There are several recent reports on expression profiling on lung cancers but the analysis interpretation of the results might be difficult because of the heterogeneity of cellular components. A contamination of the tumor sample with normal epithelia, blood vessels, stromal cells, leucocytes and tumor necrosis may confound the true expression profile of the tumor. The use of laser capture microdissection (LCM) greatly improves the sample preparation for microarray expression analysis. Consequently, we used advanced technology including LCM and microarray analysis. In detail, we examined gene expression profiles of tumor cells from 29 previously untreated patients with lung cancer (10 adenocarcinomas (AC), 10 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), 9 small cell lung cancer (SCLC)) in comparison to normal lung tissue (LT) of 5 control patients without tumor. Bronchoscopical biopsies from the primary lung tumor were taken before treatment. Biopsies were cut into 8µm sections and from each section cancer cells were isolated using laser capture microdissection in order to obtain pure samples of tumor cells. Total RNA was extracted, reversely transcribed, in-vitro transcribed, labelled and hybridized to the array. For expression analysis, microarrays covering 8793 defined genes (Human HG Focus Array, Affymetrix) were used. Following quality control, array data were normalized and analysed for significant differences using variance stabilizing transformation (VSN) and significance analysis of microarrays (SAM), respectively. Based on differentially expressed genes cancer samples could be clearly separated from non cancer samples using hierarchical clustering. Comparing AC, SCC and SCLC with normal lung tissue, we found 205, 335 and 404 genes, respectively, that were at least 2-fold differentially expressed with an estimated false discovery rate < 2.6%. Each histological subtype showed a distinct expression profile. Further, using a genetic programming approach we constructed a classificator to discriminate AC, SCC, NT and SCLC. To this end, the 50 genes with the greatest signal-to-noise ratio were selected to train the classificator. By leave-one-out cross validation all 34 samples were correctly classified in this training set. In order to validate the 50-gene-classificator on a test set, further 13 microdissected lung cancer samples were used and correctly classified in concordance to pathologic finding. In conclusion, the different lung cancer subtypes have distinct molecular phenotypes which reflect biological characteristics of the tumor cells and which might be the basis for development of targeted therapy. Moreover, gene expression profiling and genetic programming is a suitable tool for classification and discrimination of different histological subtypes in lung cancer in comparison to normal lung tissue.

GSE60542,"The biology underlying nodal metastasis is poorly understood. Transcriptome profiling has helped to characterize both primary tumors seeding nodal metastasis and the metastasis themselves. The interpretation of these data, however, is not without ambiguities. Here we profiled the transcriptomes of 17 papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) nodal metastases, associated primary tumors and primary tumors from N0 patients. We also included patient-matched normal thyroid and lymph node samples as controls to address some limits of previous studies. We found that the transcriptomes of patient-matched primary tumors and metastases were more similar than of unrelated metastases/primary pairs, a result also reported in other organ systems, and that part of this similarity reflected patient background. We found that the comparison of patient-matched primary tumors and metastases was heavily confounded by the presence of lymphoid tissues in the metastasis samples. An original data adjustment procedure was developed to circumvent this problem. It revealed a differential expression of stroma-related gene expression signatures also regulated in other organ systems. The comparison of N0 vs. N+ primary tumors uncovered a signal irreproducible across independent PTC datasets. This signal was also detectable when comparing the normal thyroid tissues adjacent to N0 and N+ tumors, suggesting a cohort specific bias also likely to be present in previous studies with similar statistical power. Classification of N0 vs. N+ yielded an accuracy of 63%, but additional statistical controls not presented in previous studies, revealed that this is likely to occur by chance alone. To address this issue, we used large datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas and showed that N0 vs. N+ classification rates could not be reached randomly for most cancers.

GSE63885,"The introduction of microarray techniques to cancer research brought great expectations for finding biomarkers that would improve patients� treatment; however, the results of such studies are poorly reproducible and critical analyses of these methods are rare. In this study, we examined global gene expression in 97 ovarian cancer samples. Also, validation of results by quantitative RT-PCR was performed on 30 additional ovarian cancer samples. We carried out a number of systematic analyses in relation to several defined clinicopathological features. The main goal of our study was to delineate the molecular background of ovarian cancer chemoresistance and find biomarkers suitable for prediction of patients� prognosis. We found that histological tumor type was the major source of variability in genes expression, except for serous and undifferentiated tumors that showed nearly identical profiles. Analysis of clinical endpoints [tumor response to chemotherapy, overall survival, disease-free survival (DFS)] brought results that were not confirmed by validation either on the same group or on the independent group of patients. CLASP1 was the only gene that was found to be important for DFS in the independent group, whereas in the preceding experiments it showed associations with other clinical endpoints and with BRCA1 gene mutation; thus, it may be worthy of further testing. Our results confirm that histological tumor type may be a strong confounding factor and we conclude that gene expression studies of ovarian carcinomas should be performed on histologically homogeneous groups. Among the reasons of poor reproducibility of statistical results may be the fact that despite relatively large patients� group, in some analyses one has to compare small and unequal classes of samples. In addition, arbitrarily performed division of samples into classes compared may not always reflect their true biological diversity. And finally, we think that clinical endpoints of the tumor probably depend on subtle changes in many and, possibly, alternative molecular pathways, and such changes may be difficult to demonstrate.",Gene expression profiling in ovarian cancer,570,,,,,,Ovarian Cancer,,GSE63885,978,101,5,0.634146341
GSE64256,"Introduction: The potential of expression profiling using microarray analysis as a tool to predict the prognosis for different types of cancer has been realized. This study aimed to identify a novel biomarker for colorectal cancer (CRC).  Experimental design: The expression profiles of cancer cells in 153 patients with CRC were examined using laser microdissection and oligonucleotide microarray analysis. Overexpression in CRC cells, especially in patients with distant metastases, was a prerequisite to select candidate genes. We analyzed the protein expression and localization of the candidate gene by immunohistochemical study and investigated the relationship between protein expression and clinicopathologic features in 271 CRC patients.  Results: Using microarray analysis, we identified 11 candidate genes related to distant metastases in CRC patients. Among these genes, Traf2- and Nck- interacting kinase (TNIK) was known to be associated with aggressiveness in CRC through Wnt signaling.  Absence of overexpression of TNIK protein was associated with significantly better overall survival (p < 0.001) and relapse-free survival (p < 0.001). Moreover, overexpression of TNIK protein was an independent risk factor for CRC recurrence (p = 0.009).

GSE66161,"Lymphocyte and breast tissue samples from overweight woman at increased risk of breast cancer before and after 1 month of intermittant energy restriction Introduction  Observational studies indicate that weight loss and energy restriction reduce breast cancer risk. Intermittent energy restriction (IER) reduces weight as well as, or more than continuous energy restriction (CER), but its effect on the breast and systemic metabolism as indicators of breast cancer risk are not known.  Methods  We assessed the effect of IER ( 2 days of 65% energy restriction) for one menstrual cycle on the breast (breast gene expression and fat cell size) and systemic metabolism (insulin resistance, lipids, serum and urine metabolites) in 23 overweight premenopausal women at high risk of breast cancer.   Unsupervised hierarchical analysis selected 100 genes with the highest variance between pre and post IER biopsies in 20 subjects, whilst mass spectrometry  was used to assess corresponding changes in serum (LCMS) and urine metabolites (GCMS) in 23 subjects in the restricted and unrestricted days of the IER.   Results Women lost on average 4.8% (± 2.0) of body weight and 8.0% (± 5.0) of body fat. Insulin resistance (HOMA) was reduced by 29.8% (±17.8) on the restricted days and by 11%(±34) on the unrestricted days of the IER. Over 250 serum and urine metabolites significantly increased or decreased during the two  restricted days and most returned to normal after the subsequent five day period . In the breast tissue, approximately half (In 11) of the subjects displayed down regulation of several metabolic pathways including lipid synthesis, growth factors and hormones, whilst epithelial genes including milk proteins, secretoglobulins and mucins were up-regulated and several metabolic pathways down-regulated including lipid synthesis, growth factors and hormones. In the other nine subjects there was no appreciable effect of IER on the breast. CorrespondingThe gene changes were not seen in peripheral blood lymphocytes, and there was no reduction in breast fat cell size. The two groups defined by change in gene expression or lack of it did not differ in the degree of weight or fat loss, other systemic metabolic markers,  or histological assessment of the biopsies.

Most of these genes were funcationally linked to cell proliferation, death and control gene expression, and include FYN, PRKCA, ITPR1, DPYD, DACH1, LYN, GBP1 and PRLR. Treatment with FYN specific small interfering RNA or a SRC family kinase inhibitor reduced cell growth of TamR cell lines while exerting no significant effect on MCF7/S0.5 cells. Moreover, overexpression of FYN in parental tamoxifen-sensitive MCF7/S0.5 cells resulted in reduced sensitivity to tamoxifen, demonstrating growth and survival promoting function of FYN in MCF7 cells. FYN knockdown in TamR cells led to reduced phosphorylation of 14-3-3 and CDc 25A, suggesting that FYN, by activation of of important cell cycle-associated proteins, may overcome the anti-proliferative effects of tamoxifen. Evaluation of the subcellular localization of FYN in primary breast tumors from two cohorts of endocrine-treated ER+ breast cancer patients, one with advanced disease (N = 47) and the other with early disease (N = 76), showed that in the former, plasma membrane-associated FYN expression strongly correlated with longer progression-free survival (P<0.0002). Similarly, in early breast cancer patients, membrane-associated expression of FYN in the primary breast tumor was significantly associated with increased metastasis-free (P<0.04) and overall (P<0.004) survival independent of tumor size, grade or lymph node status.

GSE6956,"The incidence and mortality rates of prostate cancer are significantly higher in African-American men when compared to European-American men. We tested the hypothesis that differences in tumor biology contribute to this survival health disparity. Using microarray technology, we obtained gene expression profiles of primary prostate tumors resected from 33 African-American and 36 European-American patients. These tumors were matched on clinical parameters. We also evaluated 18 non-tumor prostate tissues from 7 African-American and 11 European-American patients. The resulting datasets were analyzed for expression differences on the gene and pathway level comparing African-American with European-American patients. Our analysis revealed a significant number of genes, e.g., 162 transcripts at a false-discovery rate less than 5%, to be differently expressed between African-American and European-American patients. Using a disease association analysis, we identified a common relationship of these transcripts with autoimmunity and inflammation. These findings were corroborated on the pathway level with numerous differently expressed genes clustering in immune response, stress response, cytokine signaling, and chemotaxis pathways. Furthermore, a two-gene tumor signature was identified that accurately differentiated between African-American and European-American patients. This finding was confirmed in a blinded analysis of a second sample set. In conclusion, the gene expression profiles of prostate tumors indicate prominent differences in tumor immunobiology between African-American and European-American men.

This study aimed to identify a novel biomarker for colorectal cancer (CRC).   Methods: The expression profiles of cancer cells in 152 patients with stage I-III CRC were examined using microarray analysis. High expression in CRC cells, especially in patients with distant recurrences, was a prerequisite to select candidate genes. Thus, we identified eleven candidate genes, and selected Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK), which was known to be associated with progression in CRC through Wnt signaling pathways. We analyzed the protein expression of TNIK using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and investigated the relationship between protein expression and patient characteristics in 220 stage I-III CRC patients.   Results: Relapse-free survival was significantly worse in the TNIK high expression group than in the TNIK low expression group in stage II (p = 0.028) and stage III (p = 0.006) patients. In multivariate analysis, high TNIK expression was identified as a significant independent risk factor of distant recurrence in stage III patients.   Conclusion: This study is the first to demonstrate the prognostic significance of intratumoral TNIK protein expression in clinical tissue samples of CRC, in that high expression of TNIK protein in primary tumors was associated with distant recurrence in stage II and III CRC patients.

Recently, the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib combined with letrozole was approved for treatment of ER+ advanced breast cancer, and other CDK4/6 inhibitors are being investigated in combination with different endocrine treatments. However, the role of CDK4/6 in endocrine resistance and their potential as predictive biomarkers of endocrine treatment response remains undefined. Experimental Design: We investigated the specific role of increased CDK6 expression in fulvestrant-resistant cells by gene knockdown and treatment with palbociclib, and evaluated the effect in cell proliferation, apoptosis and kinase activity. Furthermore, we evaluated CDK6 expression in metastatic samples from breast cancer patients treated or not with fulvestrant. Results: We found increased expression of CDK6 in two fulvestrant-resistant cell models vs. sensitive cells. Reduction of CDK6 expression impaired fulvestrant-resistant cell growth and induced apoptosis by reducing p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 activity. Treatment with palbociclib re-sensitized fulvestrant-resistant cells to fulvestrant through alteration of retinoblastoma phosphorylation. High CDK6 levels in metastatic samples from breast cancer patients treated with fulvestrant (N=45) correlated significantly with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (p=0.0006), while no association was observed in patients receiving other endocrine treatments (N=41, p=0.874). Conclusions: Our results indicate that upregulation of CDK6 may be an important mechanism in overcoming fulvestrant-mediated growth inhibition in breast cancer cells.

GSE76675,"Many cancers rely on glycolytic metabolism to fuel rapid proliferation.  This has spurred interest in designing drugs that target tumor glycolysis such as AZD3965, a small molecule inhibitor of Monocarboxylate Transporter 1 (MCT1) currently undergoing Phase I evaluation for cancer treatment.  Since MCT1 mediates proton-linked transport of monocarboxylates such as lactate and pyruvate across the plasma membrane (Halestrap and Meredith, 2004), AZD3965 is thought to block tumor growth through disruption of lactate transport and glycolysis.   Here we show that MCT1 inhibition impairs proliferation of glycolytic breast cancer cells that express MCT4 via disruption of pyruvate rather than lactate export.  We found that MCT1 expression is elevated in glycolytic breast tumors and cell lines as well as in malignant breast and lung tissues.  High MCT1 expression predicts poor prognosis in breast and lung cancer patients.  Stable knockdown and AZD3965-mediated inhibition of MCT1 promote oxidative metabolism.  Acute inhibition of MCT1 reduces pyruvate export rate but does not consistently alter lactate transport or glycolytic flux in breast cancer cells that also express MCT4.  Despite the lack of glycolysis impairment, MCT1 loss-of-function decreases breast cancer cell proliferation and blocks growth of mammary fat pad xenograft tumors. Our data suggest that MCT1 expression is elevated in glycolytic cancers to promote pyruvate export, which when inhibited enhances oxidative metabolism and reduces proliferation.  This study presents an alternative molecular consequence of MCT1 inhibitors that further supports their use as anti-cancer therapeutics.",MCT1 modulates cancer cell pyruvate export and growth of tumors that co-express MCT1 and MCT4,570,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE76nnn/GSE76675/,,,,,Breast Cancer,,GSE76675,978,24,2,0.5

The signature was validated retrospectively in 5 cohorts of 972 NSCLC patients and in one prospective study of 111 NSCLC Stage IA patients. In all cohorts, and all stages of the disease, the signature identified a rare, aggressive tumor type that had a high proportion of recurrence after surgery and a median survival of 35 months (95% C.I.: 19-58). This tumor type forms a separate cluster in an analysis of the expression of the 33 genes in patient tumors.

We have previously shown that the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) adaptor proteins are necessary for linking IGF1R to downstream signaling pathways and the malignant phenotype in breast cancer cells.  The purpose of this study was to identify gene expression profiles downstream of IGF1R and its two adaptor proteins.  IRS-null breast cancer cells (T47D-YA) were engineered to express IRS-1 or IRS-2 alone and their ability to mediate IGF ligand-induced proliferation, motility, and gene expression determined. Global gene expression signatures reflecting IRS adaptor specific and primary vs. secondary ligand response were derived (Early IRS-1, Late IRS-1, Early IRS-2 and Late IRS-2) and functional pathway analysis examined. IRS isoforms mediated distinct gene expression profiles, functional pathways, and breast cancer subtype association. For example, IRS-1/2-induced TGFb2 expression and blockade of TGFb2 abrogated IGF-induced cell migration. In addition, the prognostic value of IRS proteins was significant in the luminal B breast tumor subtype. Univariate and multivariate analyses confirmed that IRS adaptor signatures correlated with poor outcome as measured by recurrence-free and overall survival.  Thus, IRS adaptor protein expression is required for IGF ligand responses in breast cancer cells. IRS-specific gene signatures represent accurate surrogates of IGF activity and could predict response to anti-IGF therapy in breast cancer.",Insulin receptor substrate adaptor proteins mediate prognostic gene expression profiles in breast cancer,570,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE78nnn/GSE78916/,,,,,Breast Cancer,,GSE78916,978,48,1,1

Despite high expression of estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) in ~80% of HGSOC and some small but promising clinical trials of endocrine therapy, ER has been understudied as a target in this disease.  Results: Proliferation is ER-regulated in HGSOC cells in vitro and in vivo, and is in part dependent on 3-D context.  Transcriptomic studies identified genes shared by cell lines and PDX explants as ER targets. The selective ER down-regulator (SERD) fulvestrant is more effective than tamoxifen in blocking ER action.  ER H-score was predictive of efficacy of endocrine therapy, and this prediction could be further improved by inclusion of target gene expression, especially that of IGFBP3.  Conclusion: Laboratory models corroborate intertumor heterogeneity of endocrine response in HGSOC but identify features associated with functional ER and endocrine responsiveness.

Here, we explored a potential role for microRNAs in such transient drug tolerance. Functional screening of 879 human microRNAs revealed miR-371-3p as a potent suppressor of drug tolerance.

We published the Genomically–Derived Sensitivity Signature for VPA(GDSS-VPA), a gene expression biomarker predicting breast cancer sensitivity to VPA in vitro and in vivo.  We conducted a window-of-opportunity study examining the tolerability of VPA and the ability of the GDSS-VPA to predict biologic changes in breast tumors from VPA. Methods: Eligible women had untreated breast cancer with breast tumors over 1.5 cm.  After a biopsy, women took VPA for 7-12 days, increasing from 30mg/kg/day PO divided BID to a maximum of 50mg/kg/day.  After VPA treatment, serum VPA level was measured followed by breast surgery or a biopsy.  Tumor proliferation was assessed by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMCs) histone acetylation was assessed by Western blot. Results:  Thirty women were evaluable.  The median age was 54(range 31-73).  52% of women tolerated 50mg/kg/day, but 10% missed more than two doses due to adverse events(AEs).  Grade 3 AEs included one patient with vomiting and diarrhea and one with fatigue.  The end serum VPA level correlated with change in PBMC histone acetylation(rho=0.451, p=0.024).  50% of women with triple-negative breast cancer(TNBC) had a Ki-67 reduction of at least 10%, compared with 17% of other women.   GDSS-VPA correlated with a Ki-67 decrease of at least 10%(AUC 0.66). Conclusions:  Most women tolerate VPA. VPA treatment caused a decrease in proliferation of breast tumors.

The aim of the present study was to define robust TNBC subtypes with clinical relevance. Methods: Gene expression profiling by means of DNA chips was conducted in an internal TNBC cohort composed of 238 patients. In addition, external data (n = 257), obtained by using the same DNA chip, were used for validation. Fuzzy clustering was followed by functional annotation of the clusters. Immunohistochemistry was used to confirm transcriptomics results: CD138 and CD20 were used to test for plasma cell and B lymphocyte infiltrations, respectively, MECA79 and CD31 for tertiary lymphoid structures, and UCHL1/PGP9.5 and S100 for neurogenesis. Results: We identified three molecular clusters within TNBC: one molecular apocrine (C1) and two basal-like-enriched (C2 and C3). C2 presented pro-tumorigenic immune response (immune suppressive), high neurogenesis (nerve infiltration) and high biological aggressiveness. In contrast, C3 exhibited adaptive immune response associated with complete B cell differentiation that occurs in tertiary lymphoid structures, and immune checkpoint upregulation. External cohort subtyping by means of the same approach proved the robustness of these results. Furthermore, plasma cell infiltration, tertiary lymphoid structures and neurogenesis were validated at the protein levels by means of histological evaluation and immunohistochemistry.

This study aims to validate γ-H2AX foci decay ratios and induced expression levels of DNA double strand break (DSB) repair genes, found in a retrospective study, as possible predictors for late radiation toxicity.   Methods and Materials: Prospectively, decay ratios (initial/residual γ-H2AX foci numbers) and genome-wide expression profiles were examined in ex vivo irradiated lymphocytes of 198 prostate cancer patients. All patients were followed ≥2 years after radiotherapy, clinical characteristics were assembled and toxicity was recorded using the Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE) v4.0.    Results: No clinical factors were correlated with late radiation toxicity. Analysis of γ-H2AX foci uncovered a negative correlation between the foci decay ratio and toxicity grade. Significantly smaller decay ratios were found in grade≥3 compared to grade 0 patients (p=0.02), indicating less efficient DNA-DSB repair in radio-sensitive patients. Moreover, utilizing a foci decay ratio threshold determined in our previous retrospective study correctly classified 23 of the 28 grade≥3 patients (sensitivity, 82%) and 9 of the 14 grade 0 patients (specificity, 64%). Grade of toxicity also correlated with a reduced induction of the homologous recombination (HR) repair gene-set. The difference in average fold induction of the HR gene-set was most pronounced between grade 0 and grade≥3 patients (p=0.008).   Conclusions: Reduced responsiveness of HR repair genes to irradiation and inefficient DSB repair correlate with an increased risk of late radiation toxicity. Using a decay ratio classifier, we could correctly classify 82% of the patients with grade≥3 toxicity.

The ER is currently the best predictor of response to the anti-estrogen agent tamoxifen, yet up to 30-40% of ER+BC will relapse despite tamoxifen treatment. New prognostic biomarkers and further biological understanding of tamoxifen resistance are required. We used gene expression profiling to develop an outcome-based predictor using a training set of 255 ER+ BC samples from women treated with adjuvant tamoxifen monotherapy. We used clusters of highly correlated genes to develop our predictor to facilitate both signature stability and biological interpretation. Independent validation was performed using 362 tamoxifen-treated ER+ BC samples obtained from multiple institutions and treated with tamoxifen only in the adjuvant and metastatic settings.  Results: We developed a gene classifier consisting of 181 genes belonging to 13 biological clusters. In the independent set of adjuvantly-treated samples, it was able to define two distinct prognostic groups (HR 2.01 95%CI: 1.29-3.13; p=0.002). Six of the 13 gene clusters represented pathways involved in cell cycle and proliferation. In 112 metastatic breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen, one of the classifier components suggesting a cellular inflammatory mechanism was significantly predictive of response.  Conclusions: We have developed a gene classifier that can predict clinical outcome in tamoxifen-treated ER+ BC patients. Whilst our study emphasizes the important role of proliferation genes in prognosis, our approach proposes other genes and pathways that may elucidate further mechanisms that influence clinical outcome and prediction of response to tamoxifen.

GSE9574,"Normal-appearing epithelium of cancer patients can harbor occult genetic abnormalities. Data comprehensively comparing gene expression between histologically normal breast epithelium of breast cancer patients and cancer-free controls are limited. The present study compares global gene expression between these groups. We performed microarrays using RNA from microdissected histologically normal terminal ductal-lobular units (TDLU) from 2 groups: (i) cancer normal (CN) (TDLUs adjacent to untreated ER1 breast cancers (n = 14)) and (ii) reduction mammoplasty (RM) (TDLUs of age-matched women without breast disease (n = 15)). Cyber-T identi?ed differentially expressed genes. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and comparison to independent microarray data including 6 carcinomas in situ (CIS), validated the results. Gene ontology (GO), UniProt and published literature evaluated gene function. About 127 probesets, corresponding to 105 genes, were differentially expressed between CN and RM (p < 0.0009, corresponding to FDR <0.10). 104/127 (82%) probesets were also differentially expressed between CIS and RM, nearly always (102/104 (98%)) in the same direction as in CN vs. RM. Two-thirds of the 105 genes were implicated previously in carcinogenesis. Overrepresented functional groups included transcription, G-protein coupled and chemokine receptor activity, the MAPK cascade and immediate early genes. Most genes in these categories were under-expressed in CN vs. RM. We conclude that global gene expression abnormalities exist in normal epithelium of breast cancer patients and are also present in early cancers. Thus, cancer-related pathways may be perturbed in normal epithelium. These abnormalities could be markers of disease risk, occult disease, or the tissue’s response to an existing tumor.

GSE994,"A number of studies have shown that cigarette smoking produces a field defect, such that genetic mutations induced by smoking occur throughout the lung and its intra and extra-pulmonary airways. Based on this concept, we have begun this study, which has as its goal the definition of the normal airway transcriptome, an analysis of how that transcriptome is affected by cigarette smoke, and to explore the reversibility of altered gene expression when smoking has been discontinued. We have obtained brushings from intra-pulmonary airways (the right upper lobe carina) and scrapings from the buccal mucosa, from normal smoking and non-smoking volunteers (including 34 Current Smokers, 23 Never Smokers and 18 Former Smokers). RNA was isolated from these samples and gene expression profiles from intra-pulmonary airway epithelial cells were analyzed using Affymetrix U133A human gene expression arrays. All microarray data from the experiments described above have been stored, preprocessed and analyzed in a relational MySQL database that is accessible through our website at http://pulm.bumc.bu.edu/aged",Effects of cigarette smoke on the human airway epithelial cell transcriptome (Lung Cancer),96,,,,,,[],,GSE994,978,75,1,0.015384615
GSE9971,"Study to identify genes associated with NSCLC recurrence in patients not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Purpose:  Recent clinical trials suggest improvement in survival with adjuvant chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  This study's aim is to identify genes associated with NSCLC recurrence in patients not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Experimental design: Banked NSCLC tumors of patients who underwent resection of stage Ia-IIIb disease were identified.  Patients were stratified into two groups: recurrent (R, n=11) or non-recurrent (NR, n=16) 2 years after surgery.  Microarray profiling and Cox multivariate analysis were performed. Conclusion:  Increased CYP3A5 gene expression correlates with NSCLC recurrence and promotes proliferation through mechanisms that may involve, in part, CYP3A5 epoxygenase activity.
